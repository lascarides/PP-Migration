    &lt;p&gt; The Akaroa Mail’s first bi-weekly issue was published on July 21 1876. It was begun by the peripatetic  ‘rag-planter’ Joseph Ivess who began nearly 30 newspapers in clusters of small towns around New Zealand for three decades from the early 1870s. Ivess sold the Akaroa Mail a year later and there were several  owners before, in 1881, the paper was bought by Howard C Jacobson.  The Jacobson family was to own and run the newspaper for 71 years. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; H C Jacobson, from Devon and educated at King’s College, London, was a school teacher before becoming, with Joseph Ivess, a part-owner of the Ashburton Mail, begun in 1877. Sale of his interest in the Ashburton paper helped fund his purchase of the Akaroa Mail. He was to run the newspaper until his death in 1910.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; His daughter Ethel May Jacobson, the seventh of 14 children, excelled at Christchurch Girls’ High School and subsequently gained BA and MA degrees in English and French from Canterbury College. She was teaching in Nelson when, in 1903, her father became ill and called her home to help run the Akaroa Mail.  She soon became editor and took full control from 1907, three years before her father died.  She was then the legal owner, manager and editor. For almost 50 years, certainly a record, Ethel Jacobson was to remain the Akaroa Mail editor. Later, her younger brother, William took care of the business side of the paper. In time, there were four staff in the printing department.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Possibly Ethel Jacobson’s greatest achievement was her growing acceptance as a pioneering women editor at a time when the role was considered a male preserve. She was to become a familiar figure, with wide-brimmed hat and hobnailed boots, riding side-saddle over Banks Peninsula’s hilly terrain to report meetings and events. There were also launch trips to Pigeon Bay and Port Levy to ensure the detailed coverage that makes the newspaper an invaluable record of Banks Peninsula life. The newspaper was also, during her long editorship, widely respected for the standard of its journalism and high quality printing.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ethel  Jacobson, who never married, retired in 1952 and died, 88 years old, in 1965. The year she retired the Akaroa Mail was sold to George R Dobbie, who had worked for the Christchurch Star-Sun, and subsequently edited the newspaper for a number of years.   In the early 1980s there was a decline in editorial standards and stock photographs were used frequently and often inappropriately. &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; Publication, continuous since 1876, was interrupted for two months in 1985 before publisher-editor Michael de Hamel took over, restored the previously high standards and substantially increased the paper’s circulation.  &lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Nō te 21 o Hūrae 1876 i whakaputaina te putanga tuatahi o te Akaroa Mail, he mea whakaputa ia rua wiki. Nā te manu takiwhenua, te ‘rag-planter’ a Joseph Ivess,  i tīmata, nāna hoki ngā niupepa 30 i tīmata i ngā kāhui taone iti puta noa i Aotearoa mō ngā tau 30 mai i te ekenga o ngā tau 1870. Kotahi tau i muri mai i hokona atu e Ivess te Akaroa Mail, ā, he āhua maha tonu ngā kaipupuri i mua i te hokotanga o te pepa e Howard C Jacobson i te tau 1881.  Mō ngā tau 71 i puritia, i whakahaerehia te niupepa e te whānau Jacobson.   &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;  Nō Devon a H C Jacobson, i kuraina ki King’s College, Rānana, he kaiako kura a ia i mua i te hokotanga o te Ashburton Mail e rāua ko Joseph Ivess, i tīmata rā i te tau 1877. Nō te hokotanga atu o tāna wāhanga o te niupepa i whai pūtea āwhina a ia ki te hoko i te Akaroa Mail. Ka whakahaeretia e ia te niupepa tae noa ki tōna matenga i te tau 1910. &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;  I tino puta te ihu o tāna tamāhine o Ethel May Jacobson, te tuawhitu o ngā tamariki 14, i te Kura Tuarua o Christchurch Girls’, ā, nō muri mai i whiwhi a ia i ana tohu Paetahi, Paerua hoki i te reo Ingarihi me te reo Wīwī mai i te Kāreti o Waitaha. He kaiako ia i Whakatū i 1903, ka pāngia tōna matua e te mate ka karangahia a ia kia hoki mai ki te kāinga hei ringa āwhina ki te whakahaere i te Akaroa Mail.  Kāore i roa i piki a ia ki te tūranga o te ētita, ā, nō te tau 1907 i riro i a ia te mana whakahaere, e toru tau tērā i mua i te matenga o tōna pāpā.  Nā konā ka noho a ia hei kaipupuri ā-ture, kaiwhakahaere, ētita hoki. I tata ki te 50 tau i noho tonu a Ethel Jacobson hei ētita o te Akaroa Mail kāore e kore he tino rongomau tērā. Nō muri mai ka riro i a William, tōna tungāne, te taha pakihi o te niupepa. I roto i te wā ka piki ngā kaimahi o te tari tā ki te whā.   &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; Tērā pea ko te tino mahi i tutuki i a Ethel Jacobson ko te whakaaetanga ki tāna mahi hei wahine pakari, hei ētita, i tētahi wā e whakaaro nuitia ana he tūranga kē tērā mā te tāne anake. Ka āhua rongonui haere a ia, tana pōtae pārua-whānui me ana pūtu hopineira, e eke taha-tera ana i te hoiho i runga i ngā puke o Akaroa ki te hopu kōrero mō ngā huihuinga me ngā takahanga. I tua atu hoki ko ngā haereere mā runga waka ki Whakaroa (Pigeon Bay), ki Koukourarata (Port Levy) hoki, hei āta whakarite i te horanga āmiki, nā runga i tērā kua noho te niupepa hei puna kōrero kāmehameha mō te rohe o Akaroa. I te roanga atu o tōna wā roa hei ētita i mihia te niupepa mō te paerewa o āna mahi rīpoata, me te kounga nui hoki o ana mahi tā.  &lt;p&gt; 
     &lt;p&gt; Kāore a Ethel  Jacobson i mārena, ā, i mutu a ia i te tau 1952, nō te tau 1965 a ia i mate, 88 tau te pakeke. I te tau i mutu ai tana mahi i hokona te Akaroa Mail ki a George R Dobbie, he kaimahi nā te Christchurch Star-Sun, nāna te niupepa i ētita mō ētahi tau.   I ngā tau tuatahi o 1980 i heke ko ngā paerewa ētita, ā, i whakamahia auautia ngā whakaahua puna, i ētahi wā anō kāore i tika te whakamahinga. &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; Tūmau ana te whakaputa mai i te tau 1876, engari i kotia mō te rua marama i te tau 1985 i mua i te taenga mai o te kaiwhakaputa-ētita a Michael de Hamel, nā konā i piki anō ai ki ngā paerewa teitei o mua, ā, i piki anō hoki te tokomaha o ngā kaipānui.  &lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; The first issue of the Albertland Gazette appeared on 14 June 1862, on board the ‘Matilda Wattenbach’, a ship bringing settlers to found a nonconformist community on the Kaipara Harbour. Samuel Johnson (1827-1905) had been engaged as printer and editor. He managed to produce a second shipboard issue despite problems preventing his cases of type from being upset. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Although the ship arrived in Auckland in September 1862, after a disagreement with settlement leader William Rawson Brame, Johnson spent time in Auckland and Dunedin, and did not arrive in Port Albert until March 1863. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; He produced the third issue, and the first to be printed on land, on 1 August 1863, and the Albertland Gazette continued to appear on a monthly basis, until the last issue on 19 June 1864. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Exhausted by his role as publisher, editor, reporter and compositor, not to mention local postmaster, Johnson quit Port Albert, and later went on to establish the Marlborough Express in Blenheim. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; The 1870s and 1880s saw a flurry of newspaper publishing in Ashburton. First there was the Ashburton Mail, established in 1877 by Joseph Ivess, a prolific publisher of country newspapers. This was followed by the Evening Echo in 1878. The next year Ivess published the Evening News to help him in his bid for the Ashburton mayoralty. Charles Dixon and Horace Weeks, the owners of the Echo, now called the Ashburton Herald, started the Ashburton Guardian to oppose Ivess’s ambitions. Ivess narrowly lost the election although it’s not clear what, if any, effect the Guardian had on this.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The town couldn’t support four newspapers so in 1880 Edward George Wright and Hugo Friedlander, the new owners of the Herald and Guardian, merged their two papers under the title of the Ashburton Guardian. In 1884 the Mail was sold to William Jules Steward. Steward had worked on various papers in Canterbury and Otago and represented the area in local and national politics. In 1885 Steward acquired the Guardian as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Steward’s political commitments (he was a Member of the House of Representatives from 1881 to 1911), made it difficult for him to devote enough time to his papers and in the 1890s he leased them to Henry Willis, eventually selling them to Robert Bell in 1900. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Robert Bell had worked on newspapers in Australia and Timaru before coming to Ashburton. He would become Managing Director of the Lyttelton Times in 1917 and Chairman of the Timaru Post in 1922. Bell closed the Mail in 1932 and died in 1937. His son W.B. Bell succeeded him as manager. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Guardian is still published by the Bell family, making it one of the few independently-owned daily newspapers left in New Zealand. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Nō ngā 1870 me ngā 1880 ka kitea ai te tini o te tā nūpepa i Ashburton. Tuatahi ko te Ashburton Mail, nō te 1877 ka tūria ai e Joseph Ivess, tētahi tino pū mō te tā i te tini o te nūpepa o tuawhenua. Nō te 1878 ka whai mai ai ko te Evening Echo. Nō te tau o muri mai, ka tāngia e Ivess te Evening News hei āwhina i tāna whai i te tūranga o te Mea o Ashburton. Nā Charles Dixon rāua ko Horace Weeks, ngā rangatira o te Echo, ko tōna ingoa hōu ko te Ashburton Herald, ka tāngia ai te Ashburton Guardian hei tohe i ngā wawata a Ivess. Ka hinga kau a Ivess, ēngari kāore i te mārama he aha te pānga mai o te Guardian ki taua hinganga nei. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Kāore i taea e te taone te tautoko i ngā nūpepa e whā, nō reira ka honoa e Edward George Wright rāua ko Hugo Friedlander, ngā rangatira hōu o te Herald me te Guardian, aua pepa e rua tahi nei ki te ingoa The Ashburton Guardian. Nō te 1844 ka hokona ai te Mail ki a William Jules Steward. Ko tā Steward he mahi ki ētahi tūmomo nūpepa i Waitaha me Otākou, ko ia hoki te māngai o taua takiwā ki te kāwanatanga ā-rohe, ā-motu hoki. Nō te 1885, ka riro i a Steward te Guardian rā anō hoki. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Nā ngā herenga tōrangapū a Steward (he Mema Paremata ia mai i te 1881 ki te 1911), ka uaua kē te whai taima mō āna nūpepa, nō ngā 1890 ka rīhingia ki a Henry Willis, te mutunga iho, ka hokona atu ki a Robert Bell i te tau 1900. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ko tā Robert Bell he mahi nūpepa ki Ahitereiria me Timaru nō mua noa o tana taenga ki Ashburton. Ko ia te Kaiwhakahaere Matua o te Lyttelton Times i te 1917, te Hiamana hoki o te Timaru Post i te 1922. Ka katia e Bell te Mail i te 1932, ka mate i te 1937. Nō muri mai i a ia ko tāna tama ko W.B. Bell te kaiwhakahaere. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Kei te tāngia tonungia te Guardian e te whānau Bell, ko ia tētahi o ngā nūpepa ruarua noa o Aotearoa, ngā mea whai rangatira motuhake. &lt;/p&gt;

  <Essay language="en">&lt;p&gt; The Evening Star first appeared in Auckland in January 1870 more by accident than careful design. With ambitions beyond his clerkship at one of Auckland’s morning dailies, the Southern Cross, William Ferrar placed an advertisement seeking a partner in a publishing venture. A former Presbyterian minister, the Rev George McCullagh Reed, responded while passing through Auckland on his way back to Australia from the West Coast goldfields, and the two men met. Despite having little capital, no influential friends and minimal experience, they quickly agreed to begin an afternoon paper, of more liberal persuasion, in opposition to the Evening News. Julius Vogel, manager of the Southern Cross, agreed to print copies of the four page paper, with Reed, who had some writing ability, the editor and Ferrar selling advertisements. &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;  However, Reed unwisely pushed his temperance views in a town with a proliferation of pubs and taverns; more wisely he sought the advice of the New Zealand Herald’s £5 a week waterfront reporter Henry Brett. Advising that the lack of hard news was the problem, Brett took a third interest in the paper and was soon in charge with a young friend, Thomson Wilson Leys, formerly sub-editor of the Southern Cross, joining him.  George Reed continued as editor until 1875, when Leys took over the role.  &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;  Brett became sole proprietor of the newspaper which was renamed the Auckland Evening Star in 1879 and Auckland Star in 1887. Brett and Leys subsequently formed a commercial partnership and successive generations of both families continued to play leading roles.  The Brett Printing and Publishing Co. Ltd. became a public company in 1920. In 1929, following the purchase of the Lyttelton Times and Christchurch Star, the company became New Zealand Newspapers Ltd. &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt; The newspaper’s growing success through the last decades of the nineteenth century was largely due to Brett’s commitment to providing as up-to-the moment news as possible. Before Auckland was linked to the telegraph, staff boarded arriving ships at the harbour entrance in specially-built boats to pick up English and Australian newspapers. Brett also used a dozen pigeons, from a Tasmanian breeder, to carry daily news from the Thames goldfields and from Tauranga where the telegraph line from Wellington ended in the early 1870s. &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt; It was claimed that the Evening Star had a circulation of 2,700 copies in 1872, rising to 4,700 three years later. In 1884, now the Auckland Evening Star, the paper’s circulation had reached 10,000. In 1898, Brett claimed the Auckland Star had the country’s largest afternoon circulation – 15,000 copies a day. &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;  The Star was one of the first newspapers in New Zealand to replace hand setting of type with linotype machines. It was also one of the first dailies to make regular use of photographs; the separate weekly magazine, the New Zealand Graphic, begun by Henry Brett in 1890, was illustrated from the beginning. &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;  The Auckland Star was a major, innovative metropolitan daily until the early 1960s. Weakened, as most afternoon papers were, by the introduction of television, the Star, and NZ Newspapers Ltd., fell prey to a corporate raider, and ceased publication in 1991. &lt;p&gt; </Essay>
 <Essay language=" mi">&lt;p&gt; I puta tuatahi mai te Evening Star i Tāmaki-makaurau i te marama o Hānuere 1870, ā, he puta pokerehū tonu, kāore i āta whānau mārire mai ki te ao. Kei kō noa atu ngā moemoeā o William Ferrar e rere ana, tētahi o ngā karaka i tētahi o ngā niupepa o te ata o Tāmaki-makaurau te  Southern Cross, i tāna mahi o ia rā. Ka whakaputaina e ia he pānui e rapu ana i tētahi hoa mō tētahi kōkiri whakaputa niupepa hōu.  Ka whakautua tāna pānui e tētahi Minita nō te Hāhi Perehipitīriana i mua, e George McCullagh Reed,  i a ia e hoki atu ana ki Ahitereiria mai i ngā keringa kōura o Te Tai Poutini, nā, ka tūtaki tēnei tokorua. Ahakoa he iti noa iho ngā moni punga, kāore he hoa whai mana nui, he iti noa iho hoki ngā akoranga o mua mō te mahi nei, tere tonu tā rāua whakaoti tikanga kia tīmataria he niupepa o te ahiahi, he āhua mākohakoha kē atu te titiro, arā, hei tauwhāinga ki te Evening News. I whakaae a Julius Vogel, te kaiwhakahaere o te Southern Cross, ki te tā i ētahi kape o te pepa, he whā whārangi te roa, ā, ko Reed, he tangata āhua matatau ki te tuhi, hei etita. Ko tā Ferrar mahi he hokohoko pānui hoko. &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;  Ahakoa tērā, kāore i tino tika ngā mahi a Reed i tāna kauwhau i ōna whakaaro puru rīpene (whakamutu i te hoko waipiro) i tētahi tāone he tini ōna hōtera, wāhi inu hoki; nō muri mai ka kimi i ngā tohutohu a te kairīpoata o ngā wāpu o te New Zealand Herald, a Henry Brett, mō te £5 i te wiki, me te nui o ngā hua o taua whakaaro. Nā Brett ia i tohutohu ko te korenga o te rongo kōrero hou te tino mate, ā, ka hoko pānga a Brett ki te niupepa. Taro kau iho ka eke ia hei kaiwhakahaere o te niupepa, me tōna hoa taitamariki a Thomson Wilson Leys, te etita o raro o te Southern Cross i mua.  I haere tonu te etita nei a George Reed hei etita, taea noatia te tau 1875 i eke atu a Leys ki taua tūranga.&lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;  Ka eke a Brett hei rangatira takitahi o te niupepa, ā, ka whakaingoatia anō ko te Auckland Evening Star i te tau 1879 me te Auckland Star i te tau 1887. I uru tonu a Brett rāua ko Leys ki tētahi mahi tahitanga arumoni i muri, ā, i noho anō ngā whakatupuranga o ngā whānau e rua ki te kawe i ngā tūranga maha.  Ka huri te Brett Printing and Publishing Co. Ltd. hei kamupene tūmatanui i te tau 1920. Nō te tau 1929, nō muri i tāna hoko i te Lyttelton Times me te Christchurch Star, ka huri te kamupene hei New Zealand Newspapers Ltd.&lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt; Ko te take i whanake ai te niupepa i roto i ngā tekau tau whakamutunga o te rau tau tekau mā iwa, ko te ū o Brett ki te hora i ngā rongo kōrero tino mohoa nei. I mua i te hononga o Tāmaki-makaurau ki te tarikarāwhe, i haere atu ngā kaimahi ki ngā kaipuke i ngā putanga ki te pūau o Tāmaki mā runga i ngā poti i āta hangaia mārire, ki te tiki atu i ngā niupepa tino hou o Ingarangi me Ahitereiria. I whakamahia hoki ētahi kūkupa kawe kōrero tekau mā rua e Brett, mai i tētahi kaiwhakatupu kūkupa nō Tahimānia, hei kawe i ngā rongo kōrero mai i ngā keringa kōura o Hauraki me Tauranga, te wāhi i mutu atu ai te waea tarikarāwhe i Pōneke i ngā tau tuatahi mai o 1870. &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt; E kīia ana i taua wā tata ki te 2,700 niupepa te tohanga o te Evening Star i te tau 1872, ā, kua piki ki te 4,700 e toru tau i muri mai. Nō te tau 1884, i raro i te ingoa te Auckland Evening Star, kua piki te tohanga o te niupepa ki te 10,000. I te tau 1898, ka puta te kōrero a Brett kua kake te tohanga o te Auckland Star kia noho koia te tino niupepa ahiahi awatea he nui rawa te tohanga o te motu katoa – 15,000 ngā kape ia rā. &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;  Ko te Star tētahi o ngā niupepa tuatahi o Aotearoa ki te whakakapi i te tāpae ā-ringa i ngā momotuhi, ki ngā mīhini linotype. Koia hoki tētahi o ngā niupepa ā-rā tuatahi ki te whakamahi auau i te whakaahua; inā hoki i puta haere tonu he whakaahua i te maheni ā-wiki, te New Zealand Graphic. Nā Henry Brett tēnei i tīmata i te tau 1890. &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;  He tino niupepa ā-rā, ā-tāone hoki te Auckland Star, nā, he niupepa nui, auaha hoki taea noatia ngā tau tuatahi mai o 1960.  He mea whakangoikore te niupepa, pēnei i te nuinga o ngā niupepa o te ahiahi o taua wā, e te pouaka whakaata. Ka raru te Star, me NZ Newspapers Ltd, ā, ka riro i tētahi kamupene horomi kamupene kē, nā, ka mutu noa iho tōna putanga mai i te tau 1991. &lt;p&gt; </Essay>

         &lt;p&gt;James Clayton established the Bush Advocate in Dannevirke (in the Manawatu) 
         on 8 May 1888. The paper intended to cover a wide area, which can be seen from 
         its rather long subtitle: 'the Takapau, Ormondville, Norsewood, Makotuhu, 
         Dannevirke and Wainui District Advertiser.'&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Clayton had installed a quality press and the Bush Advocate was well produced 
         from the start. It did not aim to represent any factional views but sought to 
         serve the business needs of the communities in which it circulated and to report 
         local news faithfully.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;The paper began life as a tri-weekly, published on Tuesdays, Thursdays and 
         Saturdays. In 1893 Clayton sold it to David Curle, who had had extensive 
         experience with Havelock and Wellington newspapers. New owners took over 
         in 1901 and renamed the paper the Dannevirke Advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;They in turn sold it to Thomas Lindsay Buick and John Ruffell Russell, 
         in 1903. The paper flourished under their control and became a daily, expanding 
         its news gathering service deep into the Hawke's Bay back country.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Buick had been a Member of Parliament for Wairau, was an accomplished orator 
         and journalist and the author of many books on New Zealand history (including 
         a comprehensive survey of the early history of Marlborough). His interest in 
         the Advocate continued until 1912 when the paper was sold and merged with 
         the Dannevirke Evening News.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The Bruce Herald was published at Milton from 1864 to 1971. It was one of New Zealand’s longest running country newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Herald was established by Joseph Mackay, a stationer and publisher from Dunedin. The Herald was one of a chain of newspapers that Mackay ran in Otago in the 1860s and 70s. Other papers in the chain included the Mataura Ensign at Gore and the Clutha Times at Balclutha.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Financial difficulties in the late 1870s forced Mackay out of newspaper publishing and in 1879 he sold the Herald to Francis Grant &amp; Co. The paper changed hands several more times over the next fifty years. Reginald Augustus Pyke was probably the most significant of the later owners. Pyke ran and edited the paper several times between 1896 and 1915. His editorial policy was unashamedly parochial as he used the Herald to advance the economic interests of Milton and Bruce County. His lobbying, through the pages of the Herald, was instrumental in attracting a woollen mill to the town. The mill was for many years one of the main employers in Milton.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Bruce Herald had a number of rivals in Milton between 1866 and 1910. The most notable were the Bruce Independent (1866-1867) and the Milton Mirror (1905-1910). The Independent provided some real competition for the short time it ran. Under Edward T. Gillon the paper gained much attention locally for its strong anti-provincial editorial policy. The impact of the Independent was such that the Herald increased the size of its issues from 4 to 8 pages. However Gallon’s views were too strong or at least too vigorously expressed for the directors of the Independent and the paper was wound up in 1867. The Milton Mirror was published by Charles Lewis Grant, a former employee of the Herald. The Mirror met with some success but was taken over by the Herald after a fire destroyed the Mirror’s office in 1910.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Herald ceased publication on 7 October 1971.&lt;/p&gt;

Ko ētahi atu nūpepa i whakauru ki taua mekameka ko Te Mataura Ensign i Gore, ko te Clutha Times i Balclutha.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Nā ngā raruraru pūtea i āki i a Mackay kia mahue i a ia te mahi whakatā nūpepa i ngā tau whakamutunga o te tekau tau mai i 1870, ā, i te tau 1879 ka hokona e ia te Herald ki te kamupene o Francis Grant &amp; Co. He nui anō ngā ringa i whakawhitihia ai te nūpepa i roto i ngā tau e rima tekau i muri mai. Ko Reginald Augustus Pyke pea te tino tangata hira o ngā kaihoko tōmuri. He nui tonu ngā wā nā Pyke te nūpepa i whakahaere, i whakatikatika hoki i waenganui i ngā tau 1896 me 1915.

		&lt;p&gt;The Bay of Plenty Times is currently one of the New Zealand's largest daily newspapers but for many years its existence was precarious and it came close to folding on a number of occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;It was first produced on 4 September 1872 as a bi-weekly publication. It consisted of four pages in tabloid size and cost three pence per issue. The founder and editor was WB Langbridge.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Ownership of the Times changed many times over the next 40 years, including several times through mortgagee sales. Despite the hardships the Times issued a Christmas supplement in 1897, which featured one of the earliest use of photographs in New Zealand newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;From 1913 the paper enjoyed stability after the Gifford and Cross families took over. Both families were associated with the paper until it was sold to Wilson and Horton in 1992. Ownership changed again in 1996 when Independent Newspapers PC from Dublin acquired a controlling interest in Wilson and Horton.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;In 1976 a fire destroyed the newspaper's entire collection of back issues. Fortunately the publisher had kept copies on microfilm and these are now held by the Alexander Turnbull Library.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Times has prospered in the last 50 years and appears secure. Its progress has been linked with that of the Bay of Plenty, which has grown rapidly and continuously since Mt Maunganui became an export port in the early 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;I tāngia tuatahitia i te 4 o Mahuru 1872, ā, e rua ngā putanga ki te wiki. E whā ōna whārangi, he nūpepa hīnohi, ā, e toru kapa te utu. Ko tōna kaihanga, tōna ētitaētita hoki, ko W.B. Langbridge.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Ki roto i ngā tau e 40 o muri mai, he maha ngā hokonga i te Times, ā, ko ētahi anō, he hoko ā-mokete. Ahakoa ngā pōrarurarutanga nō te tau 1897 ka tāngia ai e te Times tētahi āpititanga Kirihimete me te whakaatu whakaahua, arā, he mea hōu ki roto i ngā nūpepa o te wā i Aotearoa.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Mai i te tau 1883, mai i te hokonga e ngā whānau Gifford, Cross hoki ka āhua tatū te puehu. Ko aua whānau tonu ōna rangatira tae noa ki te hokonga ki te kamupene Wilson me Horton i te tau 1992. Ka hokona anō i te tau 1996, nō te rironga i a Independent Newspapers PC o Tapurini (Dublin) te nuinga o ngā hea o Wilson and Horton.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Kua puāwai te Times i ngā tau e 50 kua taha nei, tēnā pea kua tū kaha. Ko tōna whakawhanaketanga he mea haere tahi ki tō te rohe o Te Waiariki, me te tere o tāna tupu mai i te whakatūnga a Maunganui hei whanga hokotai i te tīmatanga o te tekau tau atu i 1950.&lt;/p&gt;

<Description language="en"> From the 1840s there was a good early relationship between the Ngati Awa tribe and the slowly growing number of Europeans living in the Whakatane area. This had changed by the mid-1860s. There was widespread Maori adoption of the new Pai Maire religion and the teachings of prophet Te Ua Haumene were peaceful, but the murder of Europeans in the Bay of Plenty by Hau Hau followers resulted in the confiscation of Ngati Awa’s lands.  Following Te Kooti’s raid on Whakatane in 1869, there was a determined effort by European settlers and local Maori to re-establish community and economic life in the township. </Description>
<Description language="mi"> Mai i te ngahurutanga tau 1840-1850 he pai tonu te wairua o te noho tahi o te iwi o Ngāti Awa me te tokopae āta tupu o te hunga Pākehā e noho ana i te rohe o Whakatāne. Te taenga ki waenganui i te ngahurutanga 1860-1870, kua puta kē te āhua. Kua tīmata te huri a te tini o ngāi Māori ki te whakapono Pai Mārire. He rangimārie ngā akoranga a te poropiti a Te Ua Haumene, engari nā te kōhurutanga i ngā Pākehā i te Moana a Toi e ngā Hau Hau, ka murua ngā whenua o Ngāti Awa.  I muri i te whakaekenga a Te Kooti ki Whakatāne i te tau 1869, ka tīmata anō te kōkiri a ngā kainohonoho Pākehā, me ngā Māori ki te waihanga i te oranga ohaoha, oranga hapori hoki i te tāone. </Description>

&lt;p&gt; From the 1840s there was a good early relationship between the Ngati Awa tribe and the slowly growing number of Europeans living in the Whakatane area. This had changed by the mid-1860s. There was widespread Maori adoption of the new Pai Maire religion and the teachings of prophet Te Ua Haumene were peaceful, but the murder of Europeans in the Bay of Plenty by Hau Hau followers resulted in the confiscation of Ngati Awa’s lands.  Following Te Kooti’s raid on Whakatane in 1869, there was a determined effort by European settlers and local Maori to re-establish community and economic life in the township. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Whakatane had a population of a little over 200 when the first attempt was made to establish a newspaper. The Whakatane Times and Opouriao Advocate began its short life in 1899 but there were not sufficient readers or advertisers for it to survive beyond its first two months.  The paper edited by H G Walmsley, was backed by Daniel McGarvey, a one-time compositor on Auckland’s Southern Cross.  &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In 1901 there were 781 Europeans and between 3-4,000 Maori in Whakatane County. The township’s population had risen sufficiently by 1907 for the Whakatane County Press, using the Times plant, to have more sustained success. The owner, Charles Gibbs Beckett, was well-known for starting newspapers. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  According to the Thames Star in January 1907: ‘Mr C G Beckett bids fair to rival the fame of Mr Joseph Ivess as a newspaper ‘planter’. He is the proprietor of the Northern Wairoa Times, the Whangarei Morning Press and the Waihi Times, and he is now establishing a fourth at Whakatane, to be known as the Whakatane County Press. Years ago Mr Beckett established several papers in the Wairarapa district, and for some time he owned the Inglewood Record.’  &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Following the paper’s first issue on 14 January Wellington’s Evening Post  reported  that it ‘is a double-demy sheet, and claims to be the first penny paper in the Bay of Plenty. As befits a county paper, it gives full prominence to local news and local requirements.’ It  appeared three times a week and was published in the morning. It may have been a daily for a time in 1916. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; One newspaper, at least, was less welcoming.  In December 1907 the Bay of Plenty Times commented:  ‘We notice that the Whakatane County Press makes very free  with the articles in this paper by publishing them in its leading columns as original matter. We have no objection to incompetent papers copying our articles, provided they acknowledge their source instead of stealing them.’ &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; During the period 1916-1921 Whakatane was the fastest growing town in New Zealand, contributing factors being the congenial climate, fertile alluvial plains and lower hill country and the increasing importance of the port at Whakatane. Forestry, fishing, and dairying were all important. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In 1919 the Whakatane County Press was bought by the Bay of Plenty Printing Company and in 1923 changed back to evening publication. In 1935, it absorbed the East Coast Guardian from Opotiki and the paper’s title was changed to Bay of Plenty Press. The Bay of Plenty Press stopped publication at the beginning of 1939 and two  months later F J Reynolds formed the Beacon Printing and Publishing Company and took over the Press’s machinery. The first issue of the Bay of Plenty Beacon, a tri-weekly, appeared in April 1939. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The Whakatane Beacon, as the paper is now called, is a broadsheet publication printed three times a week, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and on Fridays. It has a circulation of about 8,400. The Beacon Printing and Publishing Company also publishes the Bay Weekend, a tabloid newspaper delivered free every Saturday to every home in the greater Eastern Bay area. &lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mai i te ngahurutanga tau 1840-1850 he pai tonu te wairua o te noho tahi o te iwi o Ngāti Awa me te tokopae āta tupu o te hunga Pākehā e noho ana i te rohe o Whakatāne. Te taenga ki waenganui i te ngahurutanga 1860-1870, kua puta kē te āhua. Kua tīmata te huri a te tini o ngāi Māori ki te whakapono Pai Mārire. He rangimārie ngā akoranga a te poropiti a Te Ua Haumene, engari nā te kōhurutanga i ngā Pākehā i te Moana a Toi e ngā Hau Hau, ka murua ngā whenua o Ngāti Awa.  I muri i te whakaekenga a Te Kooti ki Whakatāne i te tau 1869, ka tīmata anō te kōkiri a ngā kainohonoho Pākehā, me ngā Māori ki te waihanga i te oranga ohaoha, oranga hapori hoki i te tāone. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Kei te 200 tāngata te taupori o Whakatane, i te tīmatanga tuatahitanga rawa o ngā mahi whakatū niupepa. I tīmata te oranga poto o te Whakatane Times and Opouriao Advocate i te tau 1899, engari kāore i rahi ngā kaipānui, te hunga whakatairanga hokohoko rānei e ora ai ia, i tua atu i ōna marama tuatahi e rua.  He mea ētita te niupepa e H G Walmsley, ā, he mea tautoko e Daniel McGarvey, tētahi o ngā kairaweke tā i te Southern Cross o Tāmaki-makau-rau. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  I te tau 1901 e 781 ngā Pākehā, i waenga hoki i te 3-4,000 ngā Maori i te takiwā o Whakatāne. Nō te taenga ki te tau 1907 kua piki te taupori o te tāone, i āhei ai te Whakatane County Press te whanake, te tū. I whakamahia e ia ngā mīhini o te Times. He rongonui te ingoa o te rangatira a Charles Gibbs Beckett, mō te whakarewa i tēnei mea te niupepa huri noa. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  E ai ki te Thames Star i te marama o Hānuere 1907:  ‘E kore pea e kore ka rite te rongo o Mr C G Beckett ki tōna hoa tauwhāinga ki a Mr Joseph Ivess hei 'kaiwhakatō' niupepa. Koia te rangatira o te Northern Wairoa Times, o te Whangarei Morning Press me te Waihi Times, ā, i tēnei wā kei te whakatū ia i tētahi mea tuawhā ki Whakatāne, e mōhiotia ai ko te Whakatane County Press. I ngā tau o mua ka whakatūria e Mr Beckett ētahi niupepa i te takiwā  o Wairarapa, ā, koia hoki te rangatira o te Inglewood Record mō tētahi wā.’  &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I muri i te putanga tuatahi o te niupepa i te 14 o Hānuere, ka puta te pūrongo a te Evening Post, i Pōneke, 'he rau double-demy, ā, e mea ana rātou koia te pepa kapa-tahi tuatahi ki te Moana a Toi'. Kia tika ai te kī he pepa ā-takiwā, e kī katoa ana i ngā rongorongo ā-rohe, me ngā kaupapa ā-takiwā.' E toru ōna putanga ia wiki, ā, ka whakaputaina i ngā ata. He niupepa ā-rā mō te wā poto i te tau 1916. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Kotahi te niupepa kāore i kaha rawa te tautoko i tōna whānautanga mai.  Nō te marama o Tīhema 1907 ka puta te kōrero a te Bay of Plenty Times:  'E kite ana mātou kei te ngana te Whakatāne County Press ki te tāhae i ngā tuhinga rongo kōrero o tēnei niupepa me te pānui anō i aua tuhinga, ānō nei nāna i tito, i tuhi. Kāore kau mātou e whakahē i ngā niupepa kaha-kore e tārua nei i ā mātou tuhinga, engari me whakaingoa i te puna i kitea ai, kaua e haere mai ki te tāhae i aua tuhinga.' &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I waenga i ngā tau 1916-1921 ko Whakatāne tētahi o ngā tāone hohoro rawa ki te tupu i Aotearoa. Ko te take ko te tū o te rangi, he huarere tino mahana, te mōmona o te oneone o ngā raorao, o ngā pārae, ngā hiwi o raro, me te pikinga ake o te mana o te wahapū i Whakatane. He mea tino nui anō hoki te tope rākau, te hī ika, me te mahi kūtētē kau. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Nō te tau 1919 ka hokona te Whakatane County Press e te Bay of Plenty Printing Company, ā, nō te tau 1923 ka hoki anō hei putanga ā-ahiahi. I te tau 1935, ka horomia e ia te East Coast Guardian o Ōpōtiki, ka hurihia te taitara ki te Bay of Plenty Press. I mutu te putanga o te Bay of Plenty Press i te tīmatanga o 1939. E rua marama i muri mai nā F J Reynolds i whakatū te Beacon Printing and Publishing Company, ā, ka riro i a ia ngā mīhini o te Press. I puta mai te putanga tuatahi o te Bay of Plenty Beacon, he toru putanga ia wiki, i te marama o te Āperira 1939. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; E kīa ana ināianei ko te Whakatane Beacon. He putanga whārangi whānui ia, ā, e toru ōna putanga ia wiki i te Tūrei, i te Wenerei, me te Paraire hoki. E 8,400 ōna kape ka hokona. Kei te whakaputa te Beacon Printing and Publishing Company i te Bay Weekend, he niupepa ā-papa, ki ia kāinga i te rohe whānui o te Moana ā-Toi ki te Rāwhiti. &lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Charleston and its newspaper appeared as the direct and immediate result of a major gold discovery in 1867, about 30km south of Westport on the West Coast.  Gold was also discovered at Brighton, 10 miles to the south, the same year. The 1867 census showed that the fields at Charleston and Brighton had a combined population of about 11,000.  There were also 53 hotels at Brighton or nearby and a further 37 at Charleston. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; After John Tyrrell had begun the Westport Times in 1866 he opportunistically added Charleston Argus to the title and briefly moved his plant to the new settlement. The Brighton Times and Pakihi Reporter had appeared earlier but was absorbed into the stand-alone Charleston Argus after it was launched in March 1867.  Tyrrell dropped the ‘Charleston Argus’ add-on from his Westport paper’s masthead in 1869.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Wellington’s Evening Post reported on 9 March: ‘Judging from the manner in which the Press is supported in gold fields districts, we may safely prognosticate for our contemporary a lucrative existence until the rich country of the Buller is worked out. The management are experienced journalists, and will probably bring out the new journal in such a manner as to ensure for it a cordial reception.’ &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In its first issue the Charleston Argus was bullish about prospects: ‘On the middle flat fortune is variable, but on the whole the fickle goddess is favourable to the miners. Water is greatly needed, however, and if this is got there is from two to three years' work before the claimholders. Fuller and party have been at work about three months here. They have cut a water race, and are now ground sluicing, and average from £10 to £14 per man per week.’ (From about $1,000 to nearly $1,500 today.) &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The well-produced bi-weekly was subsequently renamed Charleston Herald and Mining Reporter by Charles Mirfin, who later became editor of the Inangahua Herald. A further change came when the latter part of the name was dropped in favour of Brighton Times. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; John Tyrrell, an Irishman, emigrated to the United States after finishing his apprenticeship and worked there for some years. He arrived in Australia in 1859-1860 and was compositor on the Melbourne Chronicle and Ballarat Times before moving to New Zealand. After a period on The Press in Christchurch he moved to Hokitika, beginning the Hokitika Chronicle as well as the Westport Times and Charleston Argus. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In 1886, Thomas Dolman, proprietor for some years, sold the paper to Irish journalist Patrick Kittson, who had served his apprenticeship as a printer on the Melbourne Argus.  When he died in 1893 his widow and children continued the business. First, Norah Kittson’s two sons, aged 12 and 10, largely ran the paper and, following their early deaths from TB in 1902, she and her daughters continued to publish, firstly as a weekly and then more irregularly, until 1911. By this time Charleston Riding’s population had dwindled to 264. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; I tupu tōtika mai te tāone o Charleston me tōna nūpepa i runga i te kitenga o te taonga nei te kōura i te tau 1867, tata ki te 30 km ki te tonga o Westport i te Tai Poutini.  I kitea hoki te kōura i Brighton, 10 māero ki te tonga, i taua tau anō. I te tau 1867 kua eke te taupori katoa o ngā keringa kōura i Charleston me Brighton ki te takiwā o 11,000.  Kua eke ki te 53 ngā hōtēra i Brighton i kō tata atu rānei, me tōna 37 hōtēra anō ki Charleston. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I muri i te tīmatanga a John Tyrrell i te Westport Times i te tau 1866 ka tāpiritia e ia te Charleston Argus ki te taitara ā, ka nekehia e ia ana mīhini ki te kāinga hou. Kua puta kē noa atu te Brighton Times and Pakihi Reporter engari i whakahanumitia ki roto i te nūpepa tū motuhake o te Charleston Argus i muri i tōna whakarewanga i te marama o Māehe i te tau 1867.  I whakarērea e Tyrrell te tāpiritanga o te Charleston Argus i te pane kōrero o tana nūpepa i Westport i te tau 1869. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; E ai ki te pūrongo a te Evening Post o Te Whanga-nui-a-Tara i te 9 Māehe: ‘Ina tiro tātou ki ngā tini tautoko a te iwi i tēnei mea te Nūpepa i ngā rohe keri kōura, tēnei mātou te matapae nei tērā e puta he oranga nui mā tō tātou hoa nūpepa, kia pau rā anō ngā keringa kōura mōmona o te Kawatiri. He mātanga katoa ngā kaiwhakahaere, ā, he mōhio rātou ki te whakaputa i te nūpepa hou kia ātaahua ki te hunga pānui, e tino paingia ai e te iwi katoa.’ &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I tōna putanga tuatahi i te hīkaka katoa ngā kōrero o te Charleston Argus ki te takahi i te huarahi ki te ora mō ngā kaikeri o te rohe: ‘I te pārae o waenganui he āhua pai ngā whiwhinga, engari mō te nuinga e atawhaitia ana ngā kaikeri kōura e ngā atua wāhine o te whenua. E tino hiahiatia ana he wai, ā, ki te taea tēnei taonga te wai ka haere pea te kerēme mō te rua ki te toru tau. Kua toru marama a Fuller mā e mahi ana i konei. Kua tapahia e rātou he rerenga wai, kei te horohoroi i te kirikiri, ā, tōna toharite mai i te £10 ki te £14 te hua mā ia tangata i te wiki.’ (Mai i te $1,000 ki te $1,500 i ngā moni o nāianei.) &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I whakaingoatia anō te nūpepa rua putanga i te wiki, he nūpepa tino pai hoki, ko te Charleston Herald and Mining Reporter e Charles Mirfin. Nō muri ka eke ia hei etita mō te Inangahua Herald. Ka puta hoki tētahi rerekētanga mō te ingoa tuarua o te ingoa i te hurihanga ki te Brighton Times. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ka wehe atu a John Tyrrell, tētahi tangata Airihi ki Amerika i muri i te otinga o ana tau akoako, ā, ka mahi i reira mō ētahi tau. Ka tae atu ia ki Ahitereiria i te tau 1859-1860 ā, koia te kaitā i te Melbourne Chronicle me te Ballarat Times i mua i tana nukuhanga mai ki Aotearoa. I muri i tētahi wā i The Press i Ōtautahi ka nuku ia ki Hokitika, tīmata i Hokitika Chronicle tae atu hoki ki te Westport Times me te Charleston Argus. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1886, nā Thomas Dolman, te kaihautū mō ētahi tau i hoko te nūpepa ki te kaituhi Airihi ki a Patrick Kittson. I ako a Patrick i tana mahi tuatahi, te mahi kaitā i te Melbourne Argus.  I tōna matenga i te tau 1893 ka kawea haeretia e tōna pouaru me āna tamariki te umanga. I te tuatahi nā ngā tama e rua a Norah Kittson, 12 me te 10 tau te pakeke, i whakahaere te nūpepa, me kī te nuinga rā, ā, i muri i tō rātou matenga i te mate kohi i te tau 1902, nā rātou ko ana tamāhine i whakaputa te nūpepa, i te tuatahi hei nūpepa ā-wiki, ā, he āhua tīmutumutu i muri, taea noatia te tau 1911. I te taenga ki tērā wā kua iti haere te taupori o Charleston Riding ki te 264. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; The Press published its first weekly issue on 25 May 1861 – a six page paper every Saturday costing 6d – a decade after the Lyttelton Times made its appearance as Canterbury’s first newspaper. But it did have the distinction, in March 1863, of being the province’s first daily – 5,000 copies of the four-page paper were printed, selling for 3d a copy. Shortly afterwards, advertisements replaced articles on the front page. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In 1861, the principal backer was James Edward FitzGerald, Canterbury’s first superintendent and MP for Lyttelton – and also the Lyttelton Times’ first editor. FitzGerald, returning to Canterbury after an extended period back in England, disapproved of the extravagant and ambitious plans – including a Lyttelton rail tunnel – of his successor William Moorhouse. As the Lyttelton Times supported Moorhouse’s expensive schemes, FitzGerald, and like-minded settlers, put up the capital to underwrite a rival publication with a different vision for Christchurch. In the beginning, with FitzGerald writing most of the first few issues, there were violent attacks on Moorhouse and his policies but before long the paper adopted the sober, sensible standards that, over the following decades, established The Press’s reputation as New Zealand’s principal ‘journal of record’. An early contributor was Samuel Butler who wrote articles for The Press that were later woven into his famous book Erewhon. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; James FitzGerald was nominally sole owner of The Press for several years, although financially indebted to two leading Canterbury businessmen. His association with The Press diminished and later ended following his acceptance of a government appointment in Wellington in 1867. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Technical innovation became a speciality of the private companies that owned The Press, with differing shareholdings, for the next century. In 1893, the Weekly Press, which began in 1865 as a news digest for country districts, produced its Christmas number with a full-colour lithographed art cover and, for the first time, half-tone blocks illustrated the articles. In 1917, Mona McKay became one of the first ‘lady reporters’ in the country to work in a general reporters’ room, long a male preserve. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Prominent staff members included Guy Scholefield, who was associate editor of The Press (1903-04), London correspondent of the NZ Associated Press (1908-19) and later, for 22 years, Parliamentary Librarian at the General Assembly Library. While Oliver Duff was editor from 1929-1932 well-known contributors included Ngaio Marsh, Monte Holcroft and D’Arcy Cresswell. Duff resigned over editorial policy differences with the board involving a tramway strike; in 1939 he became the founding editor of the NZ Listener. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In 1970 the Christchurch Press Co. Ltd. listed on the NZ Stock Exchange; in 1987 Independent Newspapers Ltd took control; and in 2003 ownership passed to the Fairfax Group. &lt;/p&gt;

Nā runga i te mea e tautokohia ngā kaupapa nui te utu a Moorhouse e te Lyttleton Times, i huri a FitzGerald me ētahi atu tāngata he ōrite ngā whakaaro ki te whakarite pūtea hei tīmata i tētahi niupepa kē e whakahau ana i tētahi kaupapa matakite kē mō Ōtautahi. I te tīmatatanga, i runga i te mea ko FitzGerald te kaituhi o ngā putanga tuatahi, he kaha tana whakahē i a Moorhouse me ana kaupapahere, heoi anō kāore i roa i tīmata te whakamahinga o ngā paerewa mārama, whai tikanga hoki e te niupepa, nō konā, i ngā tau whai muri mai hoki, i whakatūria te ingoa o te Press hei 'pūrongo tika pū' matua ki Aotearoa. Ko tētahi o ngā kaitakoha tuatahi ko Samuel Butler, nāna ētahi tuhinga i tito mō te Press, ā, i muri mai i tuituia atu ki roto i tana pukapuka rongonui Erewhon. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;  Me kī ko James FitzGerald te kaipupuri tūtahi o te Press mō ētahi tau, ahakoa i te noho nama ia ki ngā kaipakihi matua e rua o Waitaha. I pōturi haere ka mutu hoki ana pānga ki te Press i muri i tana whiwhinga o tētahi tūranga kāwanatanga ki Pōneke i te tau 1867. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ko te whai i ngā āhuatanga hou te tino whai a ngā kamupene tūmataiti e whakahaere ana i te Press, i runga i ngā pupuritanga-hea rerekē, mō te rau tau whai muri mai. I te tau 1893 i whakaputaina e te Weekly Press, he mea i tīmatangia i te tau 1865 hei pānui pitopito kōrero ki ngā rohe kōraha, tana nama Kirihimete ki tētahi ūwhi toi kua tāngia ki ngā tae-katoa, ā, ko te wā tuatahi hoki i tātuhitia ngā tuhinga ki ngā paraka tae-haurua.   I te tau 1917, i tīmata a Mona McKay ki te mahi i te rūma kairīpoata whānui, tētahi o ngā 'wahine kairīpoata' tuatahi i te motu ki te mahi i reira, kua roa tērā he wāhi mā te tāne anake. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ko ētahi o ngā kaimahi rongonui ko Guy Scholefield, he ētita tuarua o te Press (1903-04), he kaituhi ki Rānana mō te NZ Associated Press (1908-19), ā, i muri i tērā, mō ngā tau 22, ko ia hoki te Parliamentary Librarian ki te General Assembly Library. Ko Oliver Duff te ētita mai i te 1929-1932, ko ētahi o ngā kaitakoha rongonui ko Ngaio Marsh, ko Monte Holcroft me D'Arcy Cresswell. I heke a Duff i tana tūranga i runga i ngā tohenga kaupapahere ētita ki te poari e pā ana ki tētahi taraiki o ngā terēme, i 1939 ko ia te ētita tuatahi o te NZ Listener. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;  I 1970 i whakarārangihia te Christchurch Press Co. Ltd ki te NZ Stock Exchange, i 1987 i riro te mana whakahaere i te Independent Newspapers Ltd, ā, i 2003 i whakawhitia te kaipupuritanga ki te Fairfax Group. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Clutha Leader was first published, weekly, in 1874 and was 
         the first newspaper in Balcutha to be established that has lasted 
         over time.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;While other newspapers were published in Balclutha, the only serious 
         competition came from the Free Press (1891-1926). The Free Press 
         supported the Liberal Party of Ballance, Seddon and Ward while the 
         Clutha Leader backed Massey's conservative Reform Party.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;The Leader eventually proved too strong for its rival and absorbed 
         the Free Press in 1927. Very few issues of the Free Press have 
         survived while the Leader is still published.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;The National Library recently microfilmed the Clutha Leader from 
         1874 to 1975.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; The Dominion was launched on the first Dominion Day, September 26, 1907, with the specific purpose of providing a strong conservative voice in the capital where the other morning paper, the New Zealand Times, was poorly run and had a Liberal Party heritage, and the much stronger Evening Post was more interested in business than party politics. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; When the morning daily was launched  just a year after Richard John Seddon’s death, the Liberals had been in power for 16 years and would be for another five. However, under Sir Joseph Ward, the party was in decline while the Dominion’s directors and shareholders were an impressive list of  leading conservative MPs and substantial Canterbury, Hawke’s Bay and Wairarapa runholders. Of particular concern to them were the Liberal policies on labour laws, pensions and land tenure, including the break-up of large rural estates. Unsurprisingly, the newspaper was a persuasive promoter of William Massey’s Reform Party and its policies.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;  The first editor – and he held that position, except for three years in the 1930s, until 1950 – was Charles Westwood Earle. He was also the newspaper company’s managing-director for much of the period and well-attuned to the singular requirements of his Wellington Publishing Company board. While landowner interests were pushed and ‘labour agitators’ attacked, the newspaper also supported good working conditions and backed free education. More predictably, the Dominion promoted free trade within the British Empire, sat on the fence over liquor issues, and advocated a ‘white NZ’ immigration policy. From the beginning, the newspaper’s ambitions stretched well beyond the urban confines of Wellington. There was a strong emphasis on farming news to attract readers in the Wairarapa, Manawatu and Hawke’s Bay, with correspondents in Masterton, Palmerston North and Hastings. The paper’s initial circulation of 2,600 had risen to 20,500 by 1914. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; By 1927, the Wellington Publishing Company was in a strong enough position to buy and close down the New Zealand Times. A year later it moved into the impressive, purpose-built six-storey building in Mercer Street that it occupied until 1970. &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; Over the decades, the Dominion’s political stance slowly modified. Shocked by Labour’s 1935 election win, the paper congratulated the new prime minister Michael Joseph Savage but was soon vigorously attacking the government’s ‘socialist’ policies. The hostility of the Dominion and other newspapers led to the launching of the Labour Party’s own daily newspaper, the Southern Cross, in Wellington. It was the first morning opposition to the Dominion – in both political and circulation terms – since the closure of the New Zealand Times. In 1959, eight years after the Southern Cross had closed, Wellington Publishing Company directors reaffirmed their support for the monarchy and British traditions, freedom of speech and private enterprise, but conceded there might be occasions ‘where the need for state interference was clearly shown’. There was now no direct link to any political party. &lt;/p&gt;     
    &lt;p&gt; In the 1960s, the Dominion supported New Zealand’s involvement in the Vietnam War, but also joined with environmentalists in opposing the raising of Lake Manapouri. The paper introduced front page news in 1963 and pioneered the use of bylines by journalists. Between 1968-1972 it was published as a tabloid before reverting to a broadsheet format. &lt;/p&gt;     
    &lt;p&gt; In 1964, Lord Thomson’s attempt to buy the Wellington Publishing Company triggered a takeover war, with Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch the ultimate beneficiary. The 1965 Media Ownership Act limited ownership of New Zealand media companies to 20 percent, but Murdoch’s share gradually increased to 49 percent – giving his News Corporation effective control – after the legislation was repealed in 1974. In 1972, when the companies owning the Dominion and rival Evening Post merged, the resulting Independent Newspapers Ltd (INL) grew rapidly through a succession of takeovers to become one of two dominant media companies in New Zealand.  &lt;/p&gt;     
    &lt;p&gt; In July 2002, INL’s two Wellington newspapers merged to become the morning Dominion-Post. The next year, Fairfax Media, the Australian media conglomerate, purchased, for $1 billion, most of the publishing interests of INL, including the Dominion-Post. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; I whakarewaina Te Dominion i te Rā Tōminiana tuatahi, i te 26 Hepetema 1907, ko tōna whāinga matua kia poua mai he reo whakahau tikanga tuku iho i te tāone matua. Ko tētahi o ngā niupepa o te ata, ko te New Zealand Times, he niupepa kāore i pai ōna whakahaere, he rerenga nā te Liberal Party. Ko te niupepa pakari kē ake ko te Evening Post kāore i aronui atu ki ngā mahi tōrangapū, engari anō ngā kaipakihi, i aronuitia atu e ia. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;  I te whakarewanga o te niupepa o ia ata kotahi tau i muri i te matenga o Richard John Seddon, kua eke ki te 16 tau ngā Liberal e noho ana hei Kāwanatanga, ā, e rima atu anō ō rātou tau hei Kāwanatanga i muri mai. Ahakoa rā, kua tīmata te heke o te rōpū Liberal i raro i a Sir Joseph Ward, ā, ko ngā kaihautū me ngā kaipupuru hea o te Dominion he tino rārangi whai mana o ngā mema Pāremata whakahau tikanga tuku iho, me te tini o ngā kaiupuru pāmu nunui o Waitaha, o Te Matau-a-Māui me te Wairarapa. Tētahi āwangawanga nui o tēnei hunga, ko ngā kaupapa here o ngā Liberal mō ngā ture mahi, mō ngā penihana me ngā ture pupuri whenua, tae noa ki te wāhitanga o ngā pāmu nui whakaharahara o te tuawhenua.  He tino kaitautoko tēnei niupepa i te Pāti Reform o William Massey, me ōna kaupapa here. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ko te etita tuatahi ko Charles Westwood Earle, ā, ka puritia e ia taua tūranga taea noatia te ngahuru tau mai i 1950, hāunga ia ētahi toru tau i muri i 1930. Koia hoki te kaiwhakahaere matua o te kamupene niupepa mō tētahi wā roa, ā, he tino mātau ia ki ngā hiahia motuhake o te poari o te Wellington Publishing Company. Ahakoa i tautokona ngā kaipupuri whenua, me te ngangau i ngā ‘kaipōraruraru kāhui kaimahi’, i tautoko hoki te niupepa i ngā ritenga wāhi mahi papai, i tautokona hoki te mātauranga kore utu. Otirā i tautoko te Dominion i ngā hokohokonga here-kore i roto i te Emepaea o Ingarangi, i noho hoki i te taiepa mō ngā take hoko waipiro, me tana whakahau i te kaupapa here kia ‘mā katoa te hunga heke mai ki Aotearoa noho ai’. Mai o te tīmatanga, i whātoro atu ngā moemoeā o te niupepa ki hea noa atu i ngā whaitua whāiti noa o Te Whanga-nui-a-Tara. Tērā anō hoki te whānuitanga atu o ngā pitopito kōrero mai i te Wairarapa, i Manawatū, i Te Matau ā-Māui, me ngā kaituhi i Māhitāone, i Papaioea, me Heretaunga. Ko te tohanga tuatahi o te niupepa e 2,600, ā, kua piki ki te 20,500 taea noatia 1914.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Nō te taenga ki te tau 1927, kua tino piki te kaha o te Wellington Publishing Company kia āhei ia ki te hoko, ki te kati hoki i te New Zealand Times. Kotahi tau i muri mai kua nuku mai ki tētahi whare e ono paparanga te tiketike i te Tiriti o Mercer, i nōhia e ia taea noatia te tau 1970. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I roto i ngā ngahuru tau, ka āhua rerekē haere te tūnga tōrangapū o te Dominion. Ka tumeke te niupepa i te wikitōria o Reipa i te tau 1935, ā, ka huri te niupepa ki te mihi ki te Pirīmia hou ki a Michael Joseph Savage engari kāore i roa i muri mai ka huri ki te ngangau i ngā kaupapa here ‘socialist’ a te Kāwanatanga. Nā ngā whakahē a te Dominion me ētahi atu niupepa ka huri ngā uniana ki te whakarewa i te niupepa motuhake a te Pāti Reipa, te Southern Cross, i Pōneke. Koinei te hoa whawhai tuatahi i ngā ata mō te Dominion – whawhai ā-tōrangapū, whawhai ā-tohanga hoki – mai i te katinga o te New Zealand Times. Nō te tau 1959, e waru tau i muri i te katinga o te Southern Cross, kua tino huri ngā kaihautū o te Wellington Publishing Company ki te whakaū i tā rātou tautoko kaha i te mana o te Kuini o Ingarangi, me ngā tikanga tuku iho o Ingarangi, te wātea ki te kōrero, ki te hautū i ngā mahi kaipakihi hoki. Ahakoa tērā, i whakaae anō rātou tērā tonu ngā wā ‘e tika ana kia uru mai te ringaringa o te kāwanatanga whenua.’ Kāore kau he here tōtika, mai o tērā wā, ki tētahi pāti tōrangapū.  &lt;/p&gt;     
    &lt;p&gt; I te ngahuru tau mai i 1960, i tautoko te Dominion i te hononga o Aotearoa hei whenua pakanga ki te Pakanga i Whitinamu, engari i tūhono anō ki te hunga tiaki kaitaiao i whakahē ki te whakatōremitanga o te roto o Manapouri. Nā tēnei niupepa i whakauru mai ngā tikanga tā rongo kōrero i te whārangi mātāmua i te tau 1963, ā, nāna i tīmata te mahi haina ā-ingoa a ngā kaikawe kōrero. I waenga i ngā tau 1968-1972 ka whakaputaina hei tēpara, kātahi ka hoki ki te hōputu whārangi rahi. &lt;/p&gt;     
    &lt;p&gt;  I te tau 1964, nā te kōkiri a Lord Thomson ki te hoko i te Wellington Publishing Company i tīmata tētahi pakanga hoko ohorere, ā, ko te kaiwhakaputa nō Ahitereiria ko Rupert Murdoch te toa i te mutunga iho. Nā te 1965 Media Ownership Act i whakaheke te āhei o te hunga o tāwāhi ki te hoko hea i ngā kamupene pāpāho o Aotearoa ki te 20 ōrau, engari i āta piki haere ano ngā puritanga a Murdoch ki te 49 ōrau. Nā konei ka riro te mana nui i tōna News Corporation, i muri i te mukunga atu o taua ture i te tau 1974. I te tau 1972, ka hanumi ngā kamupene nāna te Dominion me tōna hoa tauwhāinga te Evening Post, ā, ka tino whanake haere te kamupene i hua ake, a Independent Newspapers Ltd (INL) rā roto i ngā hoko ohorere maha. Ko tēnei kamupene tētahi o ngā tino kamupene pāpāho nui whakaharahara e rua o Aotearoa. &lt;/p&gt;     
    &lt;p&gt; Nō te marama o Hūrae 2002, ka hanumi ngā niupepa e rua o Pōneke o INL kia kotahi te niupepa, ko te Dominion-Post o te ata. I te tau i muri mai nā Fairfax Media, te kamupene tōpū nui o Ahitereiria, i hoko te nuinga o ngā hea whakaputa niupepa, pukapuka o INL, tae atu ki te Dominion-Post mō te 1 piriona tāra. &lt;/p&gt;

    <Essay language="en">
    &lt;p&gt;The Southern Cross was started as a weekly paper in Auckland in 1843 by prominent businessman and aspiring politician, William Brown. It was one of the two early newspapers in Auckland that ran for any length of time, the other being its main rival, the New Zealander.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first editor of the Southern Cross was Samuel Martin who had earlier edited the New Zealand Herald and Auckland Gazette for a short time in 1842.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the existence of two other papers in Auckland at the time (the Auckland Chronicle and Auckland Times) the Southern Cross developed reasonably well until 1845, when war with Māori in Northland adversely affected business in Auckland. As a result the paper stop publishing from April 1845 to July 1847.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1847 Campbell revived the Southern Cross to counteract another Auckland newspaper, the New Zealander which had started two years earlier in June 1845. The two papers represented the rival factions in Auckland politics. The New Zealander supported the ordinary settler and Māori while the Southern Cross supported the land claimants and vigorously attacked Governor George Grey's administration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this time there was nothing unusual in the highly partisan attitudes of these papers. Before 1870, newspapers in New Zealand were primarily set up for political purposes. In the absence of self-government newspapers were the main way that those who weren't officials could participate in government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1862 the Southern Cross became the first daily newspaper in Auckland, changing its name to the Daily Southern Cross. The New Zealander soon followed suit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1869 Julius Vogel assumed control of the paper but left to take up national office before he could do much with it, selling his interest in 1873. The paper had always struggled to pay its way. In the 1870s the owners were faced with the expense of shifting (the Improvement Commissioners planned to put a street through their property) and unable to agree on the direction that the paper should take. They decided to sell up instead. Alfred Horton bought the paper in 1876 and went into partnership with the Wilson brothers who owned the New Zealand Herald. At the end of that year the Southern Cross was incorporated into the Herald.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Southern Cross had started the Weekly News in 1863 and when the Southern Cross was incorporated into the Herald, the Weekly News was merged with the Weekly Herald to become the Auckland Weekly News.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The New Zealander and the Southern Cross are good examples of the way the country's press was politically aligned at the time and this was mirrored in other centres around New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Essay language="mi">
    &lt;p&gt;Nā William Brown, tētehi kaipakihi rongonui, he kaitōrangapū hoki, te Southern Cross i tīmata hei pepa ā-wiki i te tau 1843. Koia tētahi o ngā nūpepa tōmua e rua i ākarana, he mea mauroa, ko te tuarua ko tōna tāwhai, te New Zealander.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I te tau 1840 ka tae mai a Brown ki Aotearoa. Mai te tīmatanga o te tāone o ākarana, i waenga ia i ngā mahi pakihi, tōrangapū hoki a te tāone, ā, i waenga i te tekau tau mai i 1850 he tūnga tōrangapū ōna, ā-rohe, ā-motu hoki. Nāna te nūpepa mai i te tau 1843 ki te tau 1869, arā, te wā i hokona ai e ia ki a Julius Vogel. He mea piripono ki te nūpepa a John Logan Campbell, te hoa pakihi o Brown, ā, nāna te nūpepa i whakaingoa mō tētehi hōtēra i ātereita (Adelaide). He kaitōrangapū rongonui hoki a Campbell i te tekau tau mai i 1850, me ērā hoki mai i 1860.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ko Samuel Martin te ētita tuatahi o te Southern Cross, nāna hoki te New Zealand Herald i ētita i mua noa, me te Auckland Gazette mo te wā poto i te tau 1842.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ahakoa ka rua anō ngā nūpepa o ākarana i taua wā (ko te Auckland Chronicle me te Auckland Times), ka kaha tonu te whanake ake a te Southern Cross, tae noa ki te tau 1845, arā, te wā i whakapōreareatia ai ngā pakihi i ākarana e te pakanga ki te Māori i te Taitokerau. Nō reira i mutu ai te nūpepa nei mai i Paenga-whāwhā o te tau 1845 ki Hōngongoi o te tau 1847.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I te tau 1847, nā Campbell te Southern Cross i whakaara ake ai hei nūpepa whakataetae mō tētehi nūpepa anō i ākarana, ko te New Zealander, i tīmata e rua tau i mua, i te marama o Pipiri 1845. Hei reo ēnei nūpepa e rua mō ngā rōpū tāwhai o te ao tōrangapū i ākarana. He reo tautoko te New Zealander mō te marahea me te Māori, he tautoko kē te Southern Cross i ngā kaitango whenua, ā, he takitaki i ngā whakahaerenga a Kāwana Hōri Kerei.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I taua wā kāore he poka noa o te kaha o te kōaro o ēnei pepa. He kaupapa tōrangapū te whakatūnga nūpepa i Aotearoa i mua o te tau 1870. I te kore o te tino rangatiratanga, mā te nūpepa e whai reo ai ērā ehara i te āpiha o te kāwanatanga.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I te tau 1862, ko te Southern Cross te nūpepa o ia rā tuatahi i ākarana, me te ingoa hōu ko te Daily Southern Cross. Kāore i roa ka pērā rā anō te New Zealander.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I te tau 1869 ka riro i a Julius Vogel te mana whakahaere, ēngari kāore i paku whakarerekētia, ka hokona, ka mahuetia, ka whāia te tūranga tōrangapū ā-motu. Mai anō, he toimaha te utu i ngā nama a te nūpepa. I te tekau tau mai i 1870 ka ārohia ngā kaipupuri ki te nui o te utu i te nuku (he whakaaro nō ngā Kaikōmihana Whakapai Ake ki te hanga rori ki runga o tō rātou whenua), ā, kāore i āta whakaaetia me ahu pēwhea te nūpepa. Ka whakaritea kia hoko kē. Nā Alfred Horton i hoko te nūpepa i te tau 1876, ko ngā tama Wilson ōna hoa pakihi, nā rāua te New Zealand Herald. I te mutunga o taua tau, ka tōia te Southern Cross ki raro o te Herald.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nā te Southern Cross te Weekly News i tīmata i te tau 1863, ā, nō te tōnga ki raro i te Herald, ka tūhonotia te Weekly News ki te Weekly Herald, ko te Auckland Weekly News te ingoa hōu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He tauira pai te New Zealander me te Southern Cross o te whakaaro tautoko o ngā nūpepa o te motu ki ngā rōpū tōrangapū i taua wā, ā, he pērā rā anō i ētahi atu tāone o Aotearoa.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; In February 1871, when Napier’s population was 2,179, the Daily Telegraph made its first, inauspicious appearance.  With a liberal political stance – equal rights and opportunities for all – it was launched to combat the dominance of powerful land interests, and campaigned from the beginning for the break-up of the largest land blocks in Hawke’s Bay.  Managing-director and founding editor, Richard Halkett Lord, a London journalist, even suffered a horsewhipping when his witty and pungent pen outraged a reader.  However, the founding company was soon in financial difficulties and was wound-up 12 months later.  &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; The newspaper was then taken over by four of its principal shareholders: Edward W Knowles (merchant), George E Lee (barrister), Alexander Kennedy and Thomas K Newton. None had a journalistic background, but Robert Price, who replaced Richard Lord, remained editor until 1893. &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; The Daily Telegraph’s coverage was in sharp contrast to the more conservative, ‘establishment’ views expressed by its already well-established competitor, the Hawke’s Bay Herald, which moved from bi-weekly to daily publication early in 1871 in response to  the appearance of the new paper.  &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; Initially, the Daily Telegraph consisted of four (48cm x 34cm) pages, each with five columns. Usually six of the 20 columns carried news, with advertising filling the other 14. Advertising cost 3s per inch and the newspaper sold for 2d. Typesetting was by hand and the paper was printed on a single-sheet hand press.  &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; In 1879, the Daily Telegraph and Hawke’s Bay Herald’s circulations hovered around the 1,500 copies a day mark, but from 1880 the evening paper began to outpace its morning rival.  &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; The Daily Telegraph office in Tennyson Street, Napier was completely destroyed during a major fire on December 18 1886. For a period, until new premises were built, a small news sheet was produced every evening at a local printing office.   &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; By 1891, with the retirement of his partners, Edward Knowles had become sole proprietor and in 1908 when he, in turn, retired, the newspaper company was sold to the already substantial Auckland newspaper group controlled by Henry Brett, Thomson W Leys and William J Geddis.  Geddis, a member of the Legislative Council, became managing-director, beginning a long family association with the newspaper. His son Trevor M Geddis,  succeeded him as managing-director in 1921 and became editor in 1929, remaining in that position until 1951. &lt;p&gt; 
     &lt;p&gt; Until 1982, Daily Telegraph ownership had remained in the hands of descendants of the three families that bought the newspaper in 1908, but in that year it merged with the Hawke’s Bay Herald-Tribune.   Two years later the new company became part of New Zealand News, then a Brierley Investments subsidiary. In 1988, New Zealand News sold its Hawke’s Bay interests to Wilson &amp; Horton which, in turn, was bought by APN NZ in 1996.  Although the companies behind the two Hawke’s Bay newspapers had come together in 1982, it was not until 1999 that the Daily Telegraph and Hawke’s Bay Herald-Tribune merged to become Hawke’s Bay Today.  &lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; I te marama o Pepuere 1871, i te wā e 2,179 noa iho te taupori o Ahuriri, i puta tuatahi noa mai ko te Daily Telegraph.  I runga i tōna tū tōrangapū, atawhai hoki – kia ōrite ngā motika, kia whai wāhi hoki te katoa – i whakaritea kia whawhai i te mana o ngā rōpū pupuri whenua tino kaha nei, ā, i tohe hoki i te tīmatatanga mō te whakawehenga o ngā paraka whenua i Te Matau-a-Māui.  I tētahi wā, nā te whiu noa o tana pene atamai, pūkanekane nei i rīria te kaiwhakahaere matua, te ētita tuatahi hoki, a Richard Halkett Lord, he kairīpoata nō Rānana (London), e tētahi kaipānui, ka wepua rawatia.  Heoi anō, nō te paunga o te 12 marama kua raru ā-pūtea, ka pekerapu te kamupene.   &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; Nō muri mai ka riro te mana o te niupepa i tētahi tokowhā o ngā kaipupuri hea matua: Ko Edward W Knowles (kaihoko), rātou ko George E Lee (rōia), ko Alexander Kennedy ko Thomas K Newton. Kāore rātou i ahu mai i te ao kairīpoata, engari i noho mai a Robert Price tae noa ki te tau 1893, nōna te tūranga te ētita i muri i a Richard Lord. &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; He rerekē katoa te kōrero a te Daily Telegraph ki ngā tirohanga whānui ‘mana o te wā’ e whakapuakina ana e tōna hoariri kua roa e tū ana, e te Hawke’s Bay Herald, i nekehia tērā mai i te whakaputa niupepa ia rua wiki ki te whakaputa niupepa ia rā i 1871 hei urupare ki te putanga mai o te pepa hou. &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; I te tīmatanga e whā ngā (48hm x 34hm) whārangi, e rima ngā tīwae o te Daily Telegraph. I te nuinga o te wā i whakakīa e ono o ngā tīwae 20 ki ngā rongo kōrero, ko te 14 i tua atu i ērā i whakakīa ki ngā pānui hokohoko. Ko te utu o te pānui hokohoko ko te 3s ia īnihi, ā ka hokona ngā pepa mō te 2d. I mahia ā-ringatia te whakarite pū rārangi, ā i tāngia te pepa ki te perehi ā-ringa rau-kotahi.  &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1879, he tata ki te 1,500 ngā kape ia rā te tohanga o ia pepa, te Daily Telegraph me te Hawke’s Bay Herald, engari mai i te tau 1880 i tīmata te piki haere o ngā kaipānui o te pepa o te ahiahi i tōna hoariri o te ata.    &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; I turakina katoatia te tari o te Daily Telegraph i te Tiriti o Tennyson, Ahuriri e tētahi ahi nui i te 18 o Tīhema 1886. Mō tētahi wā, tae noa ki te hanganga o te whare hou, i whakaputaina he rau rongo kōrero iti ia ahiahi i tētahi tari tā paetata.   &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; Hei te tau 1891, i te hekenga o ōna hoa pakihi, ka riro i a Edward Knowles te mana whakahaere, ā, i 1908 i te wā ka heke ia, i hokona te kamupene niupepa ki tētahi rōpū niupepa nui i Tāmaki-makau-rau e whakahaeretia ana e Henry Brett, Thomson W Leys rātou ko William J Geddis.  Ka riro i a Geddis, he mema o te Kaunihera Ture, te tūranga o te kaiwhakahaere matua, nā konā i tīmata he hononga roa i waenga i tōna whānau me te niupepa. Nā tana tama a Trevor M Geddis, ia i whai ake hei kaiwhakahaere matua i te tau 1921, ā, nō te tau 1929 ka riro i a ia te tūranga o te ētita, i noho tonu a ia ki taua tūranga tae noa ki te tau 1951.   &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;  Tae atu ki te tau 1982, ka noho tonu te Daily Telegraph i ngā ringa a ngā uri o ngā whānau e toru nā rātou te niupepa i hoko i 1908, engari i taua tau i hanumi atu ki te Hawke’s Bay Herald-Tribune.   E rua tau ki muri i uru atu te kamupene hou ki te New Zealand News, he āpitihanga tērā o Brierley Investments. I 1988, i hokona e te New Zealand News āna hea o Te Matau-a-Māui ki Wilson &amp; Horton, nō muri mai i 1996 ka hokona tērā e APN NZ.  Ahakoa kua whakakotahitia ngā kamupene e rua o ngā niupepa e rua o Te Mata-a-Māui i te tau 1982, nō te tau 1999 rawa i hanumi te Daily Telegraph me te Hawke’s Bay Herald-Tribune kia puta ko te Hawke’s Bay Today.  &lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Launched in 1880, the Ellesmere Guardian was the second newspaper published in the Ellesmere area, Joseph Ivess having commenced the Ellesmere Advertiser just two days before. Both papers were published in Southbridge. The Advertiser didn’t see out the year. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Charles Edmund Sherlock, the publisher of the Guardian, had previously worked on the Ashburton Mail before moving to Southbridge. In 1886 Robert George Park assumed control. He had been a partner in the business for several years. Park moved the Guardian office to Leeston. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The next few years appear to have been difficult ones for the Guardian. Publication was suspended in the late 1880s and the paper changed hands frequently. Things improved in 1892 when William Zouch, formerly of the Ashburton Guardian, moved the paper back to Southbridge. Circulation soon rose from 800 to 1200 issues. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In 1897 Cecil Rhys Thornton became editor. He was an ardent prohibitionist and used the paper to promote this cause. His zealousness landed him in court in 1899 when he was sued for libel for comments made in the paper. Thornton left to work on the Inangahua Times in 1904. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Horace McMillan, a 19 year old reporter on the paper, bought the Guardian in 1908 and remained in charge until retiring in 1947. Under his management the paper flourished, becoming one of the better country newspapers in the Dominion. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; McMillan moved operations back to Leeston in 1916. The paper remained there until it merged with the Malvern Record to form the Central Canterbury News in 1983.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Note: only two issues of the Guardian are known to exist before 1891. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; He mea whakarewa i te 1880, ko te Ellesmere Guardian te nūpepa tuarua kia tāngia i te rohe o Ellesmere, nō ngā rā e rua o mua tata noa ka tāngia ai e Joseph Ivess te Ellesmere Advertiser. He mea tā aua pepa e rua nei i Southbridge. Kīhai i pau te tau, ka kore noa te Advertiser. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I mua noa te mahi a Charles Edmund Sherlock, te kaitā o te Guardian, ki te Ashburton Mail ka nuku ai ki Southbridge. I te 1886 ka riro i a Robert George Park te whakahaeretanga. I roto i ngā tau mahi ko ia tētahi o ngā hoa pakihi ki te umanga. Ka nukuhia e ia te tari o te Guardian ki Leeston. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Te āhua nei ko ngā tau ruarua o muri mai he mea uaua mō te Guardian. Ka whakatārewatia te tānga i ngā tau whakamutunga o ngā 1890, ka riro atu ka riro mai te rangatiratanga. Nō te 1892, nō te whakahokitanga o te nūpepa ki Southbridge e Willliam Zouch, i te Ashburton Guardian i mua, ka haere pai ake ai. Ka tupu te horahanga mai i te 800 tānga ki te 1200.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I te 1897 ka tū ko Cecil Rhys Thornton hei etita. He whakapaunga kaha nōna ki te aukati waipiro, ā, nāna te nūpepa i whakamahi hei tautoko i taua take nei. Nā taua whakapaunga kaha ka hāmenetia ia i te 1899 mō te takahi mana mai i āna tuhinga ki te nūpepa. I te 1904 ka nuku atu a Thornton ki te Inangahua Times. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Nā Horace McMillan, tētahi kairipoata i te nūpepa ka 19 ana tau, nāna te Guardian i hoko i te 1908, ka mau tonu tae noa ki tana rītāitanga i te 1947. I raro i a ia ka pūāwai te nūpepa, ko ia nei tētahi o ngā nūpepa tuawhenua papai ake o te Tōminiona. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ka whakahokia e McMillan ngā whakahaeretanga ki Leeston i te 1916. Ka noho te nūpepa ki reira tae noa ki tōna tuhonotanga ki te Malvern Record ka tū ai te Central Canterbury News i te 1983. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Evening Post was founded by Henry Blundell and began publication as a daily in Wellington on 8 February 1865. Blundell was born in Dublin in 1813 and worked for nearly 30 years at the Dublin Evening Mail. In 1860 he migrated with his family to Melbourne. Blundell moved to New Zealand in 1863 and worked on the Otago Daily Times. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1864 he founded the Havelock Mail. However the Marlborough goldfields were failing at this time and the Mail only lasted a few months, closing in November the same year. Blundell, business partner David Curle, and Blundell’s two sons, John and Henry, then decided to try their luck in Wellington, which at that time did not have a daily newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wellington had just become the colony’s capital and the Blundells decided that this, combined with the state of the other newspapers being published in Wellington at the time, made starting a daily newspaper there a sound business proposition. The only rivals to the Post were the tri-weekly Wellington Independent and the New Zealand Advertiser, and the weekly New Zealand Spectator, which was in poor health and closed in August 1865. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was therefore a strong opportunity for a daily paper in Wellington.The Post was a family business, with father Henry being manager and principal leader writer, and sons Henry junior, John and Louis, who joined the firm on completing his schooling in Dunedin, being typesetters, canvassers and reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new paper aimed to record every event ‘within a mile of Martin’s fountain’ which lay at the corner of Featherston Street and Lambton Quay. By focussing on local issues, attention to detail and high-quality writing the Post soon established itself as the leading Wellington paper, a position it did not relinquish during its long career. Its editorial policy was politically neutral. Unlike other papers of the time, which were established to publicise a particular political opinion, the Post was not aligned to any political factions and was therefore able to comment freely on political and other matters. As Blundell wrote in the Post’s first edition, ‘a liberal course of policy will be pursued and the bounds of moderation will not be overstepped in giving expression to the views entertained by the proprietors as journalists.’ &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Henry Blundell senior died in 1878 and the paper continued to be run by his sons, with Frank Gifford as editor. Perhaps because it was such a locally focussed paper-Wellington’s paper-the Post was able to outlast it various rivals over the years. The Post’s only serious competition was the Dominion, which began publication in September 1907. The Dominion was founded to be the voice of the conservative element in Wellington politics, and as such was at the opposite end of the political spectrum to the Post. This, combined with the fact that the Dominion was a morning rather than an evening paper, meant that serious competition with the Post was not an issue as each had its own niche in the capital city. The Blundell family retained control of the paper until the late 1960s. The 1970s saw a steady decline in the Post’s circulation and the Dominion, which had been somewhat in the Post’s shadow throughout its career, gradually eclipsed its rival. In 1972 ownership of the Post was combined with the Dominion and in 2002 the Post’s owners decided to close the paper and merge it with the Dominion to create the Dominion Post. The final edition of the Evening Post was published on 6 July 2002, ending what has been called a 137-year love affair with Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;

Kātahi ka taka te whakaaro i a Blundell rātou ko tōna hoa pakihi a David Curle me ngā tama tokorua a Blundell, a John rāua ko Henry, ki te whakatū nūpepa ki Te Whanganui-a-Tara. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I taua wā kāore he nūpepa o ia rā ki taua tāone. Ki tā Blundell titiro, he wā pai mō te whakatū nūpepa ia rā ki Te Whanganui-a-Tara nā te mea, kātahi anō ka tohungia ko Te Whanganui-a-Tara hei tāone matua mō Niu Tīreni, tāpae atu ko te tūpuhi o ngā nūpepa o Te Whanganui-a-Tara i taua wā. E toru anake ngā nūpepa hei whakataetae mā te Evening Post – ko te Wellington Independent, ko te New Zealand Advertiser hoki – e toru wā i te wiki ka puta; ko te New Zealand Spectator – kotahi te wā i te wiki ka puta. Kāore i te pai te haere o te New Zealand Spectator, ā, nō te marama o Here-turi-kōkā o te tau 1865 ka kati. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He umanga te Post nā te whānau Blundell – ko Henry te kaiwhakahaere me te kaitito matua, ko ana tama a Henry te tuarua, a John me Louis ka mahi hei whakarauwaka tuhinga, hei kaikawe pūrongo, hei kaihoko nūpepa hoki. I te otinga rawa o tana kura ki Ōtepoti ka kuhu a Louis ki te nūpepa mahi ai. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ko te whāinga o te nūpepa, kia tangohia ngā kōrero katoa ‘within a mile of Martin’s fountain’ [kei roto i te kotahi maero i te puna torotī a Mātene], kei te kokonga o te huarahi o Featherston me Lambton Quay. Mā te hāngai pū ki ngā take o tōna takiwā, te tika o āna kōrero me te koi o ngā tuhinga ka matika te Post hei nūpepa matua o Te Whanganui-a-Tara; kāhore ia ka hinga i tēnei tūranga i roto i ngā tau. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ka noho whakaraupapa i ngā take tōrangapū ngā tuhinga a te Post. Kāore te Post i rite ki ērā o ngā nūpepa o te wā ka whirinaki ki tētahi rōpū tōrangapū; nā reira tareka ai tana whakatakoto kōrero here kore mō ngā take tōrangapū me ētahi atu kaupapa. Nā Blundell tonu te kōrero i takoto ki te nūpepa: ‘ a liberal course of policy will be pursued and the bounds of moderation will not be overstepped in giving expression to the views entertained by the proprietors as journalists’ [Ka whānui te titiro a te nūpepa ki ngā take katoa. Heoi, i a rātou ka mahi hei kaikawe pūrongo, kāhore te hunga nō rātou te nūpepa e takahi i ngā whanonga pai.] Ka mate a Henry Blundell te matua i te tau 1878.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heoi, ka haere tonu te nūpepa i raro i ngā whakahaere o ana tama me Frank Gifford hei ētita. Nā te hāngai pū o te titiro a te Evening Post ki ngā take o Te Whanganui-a-Tara i kaha ai ia i roto i ngā tau, ahakoa te hingahinga o ngā hoa tauwhāinga i te wā. Ko te Dominion anake te nūpepa kaha ki te tauwhāinga ki te Post. Nō te marama o Mahuru o te tau 1907 tīmata ai te Dominion. I whakatūria te Dominion ki te whakaputa i ngā kōrero o te taha matau o te ao tōrangapū ki roto o Te Whanganui-a-Tara. Hei ngā ahiahi o ia rā ka puta; kāore i pērā i te Post hei ngā ata ka puta. Koianei pea ngā take i ora ai, i pakari ai ngā nūpepa e rua nei mō ngā tau maha. Kia tae rā anō ki te tekau tau atu i 1960 ko te whānau Blundell te mana whakahaere i te Post. Hei te tekau tau atu i 1970 ka paheke te Post ka iti haere ngā nūpepa kei te hokona. Ka eke ko te Dominion ki runga ake. I te tau 1972 ka taka ngā nūpepa e rua ki raro i te mana whakahaere kotahi. I te tau 2002 ka whakatau ngā rangatira o te Post me kati taua nūpepa ka hanumi ki te Dominion kia puta ko te Dominion Post. Nō te rā 6 o Hōngongoi o te tau 2002 te putanga whakamutunga o te Post, e 137 tau mai i tōna pueanga.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Essay language="en">
    &lt;p&gt;Fair Play, subtitled "An illustrated journal for sensible men and women", was published in Wellington by the well-known printing firm McKee and Gamble from 1893 to 1894.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although registered as a newspaper, it was more correctly classified as an illustrated serial, focusing on political and cultural topics as well as gossip, sport, light literature and satirical sketches of public figures. It was published weekly from November 1893 to April 1894, and then monthly from May 1894 to November 1894, when it stopped being produced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fair Play aimed to be liberal and unbiased, declaring itself to be "against prohibition of any kind" and free from the "manacles" and "slavish obedience" to political and social interests it saw constraining the rest of the New Zealand press.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although the paper billed itself as "an unprejudiced New Zealand weekly" and proudly declared that "Fair Play is a jewel", it was strongly opinionated. Fair Play stated in the first issue that when it came to prominent citizens it intended to "attack [them] honestly and fairly in the lists of public opinion". However this policy may have backfired on the paper's publishers. A successful libel suit brought by Francis Dillon Bell against Fair Play in February 1894 may have damaged it both publicly and financially.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original editor, WE Hammond, arrived from Australia in June 1893 to take up the position but resigned in April 1894 when it was decided to change from weekly to monthly publication. Arthur McKee, previously the paper's manager and one of its publishers, took over the editorship in May 1894, promising more local content. If the change in format was intended to rejuvenate the paper, it did not succeed and the last issue appeared in November 1894.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason for Fair Play's demise is uncertain. Although the paper was similar to the successful Auckland paper the New Zealand Observer and the later New Zealand Free Lance, it may have been that Fair Play was too opinionated and satirical for its own good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arthur McKee continued to have a successful career, being one of the directors of the well-known Cyclopedia of New Zealand, as well as continuing his partnership in the McKee and Gamble publishing company. WE Hammond took a job with the New Zealand Times and worked in journalism in Auckland before leaving New Zealand in 1900.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ko Fair Play, i whakaingoa tuaruahia "He hautaka waituhi mō ngā tāne me ngā wāhine whai whakaaro", i whakaputaina ki Pōneke e te kamupene kaitā rongonui a McKee me Gamble mai i te tau 1893 ki te tau 1894.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ahakoa i rēhitatia hei nūpepa, ko te āhua tōtika kē he pukapuka raupapa whai whakaahua e whakaatu ana i ngā take tōrangapū, ahurea hoki me ngā kohimu, ngā tākaro, ngā pakiwaitara me ngā waituhi whakarōrā o ngā kaitōrangapū, Hōpara i ngā pānuitangata whakarae hoki. I whakaputaina ā-wiki a Fair Play ki Pōneke mai i Whiringa-ā-rangi o 1893 tae noa ki te Paenga-whāwhā o 1894, ā, ka huri kia whakaputaina ā-marama mai i Haratua 1894 ki Whiringa-ā-rangi 1894, arā, te wā i mutu ai te whakaputa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I whai a Fair Play kia tōkeke kia tū wātea hoki, e kī ai ia "e whakahē ana i ngā momo aukati katoa", ā, kia wātea mai i ngā ringamau me ngā whakamārōrō pononga ki ngā whāinga tōrangapū me ngā whāinga hapori i kitea ake ai e ia e aukati kē ana i te katoa o ngā nūpepa o te motu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ahakoa te kī a te nūpepa "he whakaputanga ā-wiki kōaro kore" me tana whakatau ake "he kurupounamu a Fair Play", ka nui anō te pākiwaha. I whakatauhia ake e Fair Play i tōnā putanga tuatahi kia tae ki Hōpara i ngā pānuitangata rongonui ko tōna whāinga "ki te wero hāngai tonu atu mā ngā whakaaro tūmatanui". Hei ahakoa i huri kē mai tēnei kaupapa whakahaere ki te poke i ngā kaiwhakaputa o taua nūpepa. Tērā pea nā te whiwhi o Francis Dillon Bell i tana whakarite kupu whakakino ki a Fair Play i Hui-tangaru o te tau 1894 i ngahoro ai tōna tūranga tūmatanui, pūtea hoki.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ko te ētita tuatahi, a W. E. Hammond, i tae mai ki Pōneke mai i Ahitereiria i te marama o Pipiri 1893 ki te kawe i taua tūranga, ēngari ka whakawāteahia i Paenga-whāwhā o te tau 1894 i te wā i whakaritea ai kia huri mai i te whakaputanga ā-wiki ki te whakaputanga ā-marama. I riro mā Arthur McKee, te kaiwhakahaere i mua o te nūpepa me tētahi o ana kaiwhakaputa, e kawe te mahi ētita nō te Haratua o te tau 1894. Ko tana kī taurangi, kia puta ake ngā take ā-rohe. Meina i whakaarohia mā tēnei huringa e piki ake ai te āhua o te nūpepa, kīhai i tutuki, ā, i oti te tānga whakamutunga i Whiringa-ā-rangi o te tau 1894.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kāhore i tino mārama te pūtake mō te ngaromanga o Fair Play. Ahakoa te ōrite o te nūpepa nei ki te nūpepa rongonui o ākarana, arā, te New Zealand Observer, ā, i muri mai ko te New Zealand Free Lance, tērā pea nā te āta whakahīhī, whakarōrā anō hoki o te Fair Play i raru ai.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ka piki tonu te mahi whai hua a Arthur McKee, ko ia hoki tētahi o ngā kaiwhakahaere o te Cyclopedia o New Zealand me tana kawe tonu i tana hononga i roto i te kamupene whakaputa pukapuka o McKee and Gamble. I kawea ake e W. E. Hammond tētahi tūranga mō te New Zealand Times, ā, ka mahi tonu ki roto i ngā kōrero ā-nūpepa ki ākarana i mua i tana wehenga atu i Aotearoa nei i te tau 1900.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Feilding Star was the first newspaper to publish in Feilding. The Feilding
        area had been developing through the 1870s driven by the settlement of
        the Manchester Block and the linking by rail of Feilding with other towns
        in the Manawatu and Horowhenua. The conditions were right for a newspaper
      to set up there.&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;The paper, initially called the Feilding Guardian, was established by George
        Capper and David Curle in 1879. In 1882 the paper was sold to George
        Kirton and Augustus Robert Curtis, who changed the title to the Feilding
        Star. The paper became a daily in 1893 in response to increasing competition
        from newspapers in other towns in the area, particularly Palmerston North.&lt;/p&gt;		
      &lt;p&gt;In 1906 the Star was acquired by its best known owner, Frederick
        Pirani. Pirani had been a Member of the House of Representatives for
        Palmerston North from 1893 to 1902. Pirani was a radical Liberal whose
        combative style often got him embroiled in conflict, most notably with
        Seddon, the Premier and leader of his party. Consequently Seddon endorsed
        a rival candidate for Palmerston North for the 1899 election. Despite
        this Pirani retained his seat.&lt;/p&gt;		
      &lt;p&gt;The Feilding Star was not Pirani’s first venture into newspaper
        publishing. He had previously worked as a journalist and owned the Manawatu
        Standard and Hutt and Petone Chronicle.&lt;/p&gt;		
      &lt;p&gt;The Feilding Star ceased publication in October 1939 citing
    as the cause a newsprint shortage due to the War.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ko te Feilding Star te nūpepa tuatahi ki te whakatā ki Aorangi (Feilding). Kua whanake haere te takiwā o Aorangi i roto i te tekau tau mai i 1870, he mea akiaki nā te nōhanga o te poraka whenua o Manchester, nā te hononga hoki o Aorangi ki ētahi atu tāone o Manawatū me Horowhenua. I tika tonu ngā āhuatanga hei whakatū i tētahi nūpepa ki reira. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ko te nūpepa, i huaina ai ko te Feilding Guardian i te tīmatanga, nā George Capper rāua ko David Curle i whakaū i te tau 1879. I hokona atu te nūpepa i te tau 1882 ki a George Kirton rāua ko Augustus Robert Curtis, nā rāua te ingoa i whakawhiti ki te Feilding Star. Ka whakaputaina te nūpepa ia rā mai i te tau 1893, he urupare ki te tauwhāinga i piki ake ai i ētahi atu nūpepa i ērā atu tāone o taua takiwā, motuhake i Te Papa-i-oea (Palmerston North). &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1906, ka hokona mai te Star e tōna rangatira tino rongonui, a Frederick Pirani. Kua tū hoki a Pirani hei Mema Pāremata mō Te Papa-i-oea mai i te tau 1893 ki 1902. He Rīpera tuwhena a Pirani, i whakaurua nuitia ai ki te whawhai e tōna āhua tū atu, motuhake ki a Te Hētana (Seddon), te Pirimia, te kaiārahi hoki o tōna rōpū tōrangapū. Nō reira, i tautokona e Te Hētana tētahi kaitono tāwhai mō te rohe pōti o Te Papa-i-oea i te pōtitanga o 1899. Ahakoa rā, i mau tonu i a Pirani tōna tūru. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ehara hoki te Feilding Star i tā Pirani toronga tuatahi ki te tānga nūpepa. Kua mahi kē ia hei kaituhi kōrero, ā, nōna hoki a te Manawatu Standard, a te Hutt and Petone Chronicle hoki.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Essay language="en">
    &lt;p&gt; The Grey River Argus was a rarity amongst New Zealand newspapers in that it was open about its political affiliations. The Argus supported the Labour Movement. For many years the legend, “New Zealand’s pioneer Labor daily” appeared on the masthead. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Argus was the first newspaper published in Greymouth, the first issue appearing on  14 November 1865. The publisher, James Kerr (1834-1901), had worked on newspapers in Scotland, Melbourne and Dunedin before coming to Greymouth. He became well known throughout the West Coast through his involvement in local and national politics. He was a close friend of Richard Seddon’s and was a member of the Legislative Council. He remained the principal proprietor of the Argus until his death. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Initially the Argus was published three times a week. In 1871 the paper became a daily. From 1870 to 1907 it published a weekly edition called the Weekly Argus. The Argus survived two fires and several floods in its first few years. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Argus was fortunate to have several very capable editors in the nineteenth century. 
These were William Henry Harrison (1831-1879) and Florence Romuald McCarthy (1834-1914). Harrison was editor from 1868 to 1879 and McCarthy from 1880 to 1914. They earned the Argus a national reputation for the quality of its journalism. &lt;/p&gt;    
    &lt;p&gt; Kerr’s son James became manager of the paper after his father’s death and in 1906  formed the Grey River Argus Company. In 1912 the other daily newspaper in Greymouth, the Greymouth Evening Star, considered buying a controlling share in the paper but decided that the price was too high. The next year the Federation of Labour began negotiating with the owners to buy the paper. Most of the New Zealand press were unsympathetic, often hostile, towards Labour. The Federation thought that they needed a paper of their own to counteract this. Buying the Argus made sense given the strong support that Labour enjoyed on the West Coast. &lt;/p&gt;    
    &lt;p&gt; Negotiations were protracted and it wasn’t till 1919 that the West Coast trade unions acquired the paper. However the Argus was, in effect, already a Labour paper by the time it was sold. In 1918 the paper allowed the Grey Labour Representation Committee to use its columns to support Harry Holland contest the Grey seat in that year's election. Future Prime Minister Peter Fraser was responsible for the Labour campaign on the West Coast and wrote editorials for the Argus during this time. The Argus was considered to have contributed to the election of Labour candidates in 1918 for the seats of Grey and Buller.   &lt;/p&gt;    
    &lt;p&gt; The early years of the Argus under union management were difficult. The cost of newsprint was high, advertisers were reluctant to use a Labour paper and a few months after assuming control, fire destroyed the Argus office and plant. This was quickly rebuilt by volunteers. The Hokitika Guardian printed the Argus during this time, ensuring that publication was maintained. &lt;/p&gt;    
    &lt;p&gt; The Argus had one rival, the Greymouth Evening Star. The Star began publishing in March 1866. The two papers frequently attacked each other. The Star editorials referred to the Argus as “Labour-Socialists” and the Argus called the Star “Tory-Nationalists”.  &lt;/p&gt;    
    &lt;p&gt; In 1966 the Grey River Argus Company was taken over by Buller Westland Publishing Company and the paper was relaunched in February of that year with the new title of the Argus Leader. The Labour affiliation was toned down. “New Zealand’s pioneer Labor daily” was dropped from the front page. These changes failed to save the Argus and it  closed in November. The following notice appeared on the front page of the last issue, “Last evening, the directors of the Buller Westland Publishing Co. Ltd., decided that the “Argus Leader” would cease publication with this morning’s issue.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; He rerekē tā Grey River Argus, ki tāna whakapuakitanga i ōna pānga tōrangapū. He tautoko tāna i te Kaupapa Reipa. Huri kau ngā tau, kei tōna uwhi te tohu, “Ko ia nei te nūpepa tuatahi mō Reipa”. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ko te Argus te nūpepa tuatahi kia tāngia mai i Greymouth, ko tōna tānga tuatahi ka puta mai i te 14 o Whiringa-ā-rangi 1865. Ko tōna kaiwhakaputa, ko James Kerr (1834-1901), he kaimahi nūpepa i Kotirangi, i Poipiripi me Otepoti i mua i tana haerenga mai ki Greymouth. He rongonui huri noa te Tai Hauāuru mai i ana pānga ki te tōrangapū ā-rohe, ā-motu hoki. He hoa piritata nō Richard Seddon, he mema hoki o te Kaunihera Ā-Ture. Ko ia te rangatira mātāmua o te Argus tae noa ki tōna matenga. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt; I te tuatahi, ka toru ngā tānga o te Argus ia wiki. Nō te 1871 ka tāngia ai ia rā. Mai i te 1870 ki te 1907 he whakaputanga ā-wiki, ko te Weekly Argus. I ngā tau tīmatanga i ora mai te Argus ahakoa ngā muranga e rua ki te ahi, me ētahi waipukenga maha hoki. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt; He waimarie te Argus i ngā pukenga o ōna etita i te rautau tekau mā iwa. Ko ēnei ko William Henry Harrison (1831-1879) me Florence Romuald McCarthy (1834-1914). Ko Harrison te etita mai i te 1868 ki te 1879, ko McCarthy mai i te 1880 ki te 1914. Nā rāua rā anō i nui ai te mana o te Argus i te motu mō te kounga o ana pūrongo ā-nūpepa. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt; Nō te matenga o Kerr ko tāna tama a James hei kaiwhakahaere o te nūpepa ā, nō te 1906 nāna te Grey River Argus Company i whakatū. I te 1912 ka whakaarohia e te Greymouth Evening Star, tērā atu o ngā nūpepa o reira, te hoko hea nui ake o te nūpepa, ēngari he nui rawa nō te utu. No te tau o muri mai ka whakarite te Federation of Labour ki te hoko i te nūpepa mai i ana rangatira. Ko te nuinga o ngā pāpāho o Aotearoa kāore i te rata mai, i ētahi wā he kaikiri, ki a Reipa. Ko tāna he hoko nūpepa mōna ake hei karo i ēnei tūāhua. He tau te hoko i te Argus nā te kaha o te tautoko i a Reipa i te Tai Hauāuru. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ka takaroa ngā whakaritenga tae noa ki te 1919 ka riro ai te nūpepa i ngā ūniana o te Tai Hauāuru. Heoi anō kua tau kē te Argus hei nūpepa mō Reipa i te wā i hokongia ai. I te 1918 ka tukua e te nūpepa te whakamahi a te Grey Labour Representation Committee i ōna pae hei tautoko i a Harry Holland mō te tūru o Grey i ngā pōti o taua tau. Nā Peter Fraser, Pirimia o muri mai, te whakahau mō Reipa i te Tai Hauāuru, me ētahi o ngā tuhinga a te etita o te Argus i taua wā. E whakaponotia ana he pānga nui a te Argus ki te pōtitanga o ngā māngai o Reipa i te 1918 mō ngā tūru o Grey me Buller.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ko ngā tau moata o te Argus i raro i ngā ūniana he uaua. He nui te utu o te pepa tā, he whakahoihoi nō ngā kaiutu pānui ki te whai i te pepa Reipa ā, kāore i roa o muri mai i te rironga o te mana whakahaere, ka turakina te tari me te wheketere o te Argus ki te ahi. Ka tere whakahoungia e te hunga tūao. Nā te Hokitika Guardian te Argus i tāngia i tēnei wā ka puta tonu mai ai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Kotahi tonu te hoa tauwhāinga o te Argus ko te Greymouth Evening Star. Nō te Paengawhāwhā o te 1866 ka tīmata ai te puta o te Star. Taukumekume ai ngā pepa e rua nei. Ko tā te Star mō te Argus he “Labour-Socialists” ko tā te Argus mō te Star he “Tory-Nationalists”.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Nō te 1966 ka riro te Grey River Argus Company i te Buller Westland Publishing Company, ka māunu anō ai te nūpepa i te Huitanguru o taua tau nei me tōna ingoa hōu, te Argus Leader. Ka whakangāwarihia te pānga ki a Reipa. Ka kore te “Ko ia nei te nūpepa tuatahi mō Reipa” mai i te uwhi.  Kāore te Argus i ora mai i ēnei whakarerekētanga ka katia ai i te Whiringa-ā-rangi. Ko ia nei te pānui i te uwhi o te putanga whakamutunga, “Nō tērā ahiahi ka whakatauria ai e ngā rangatira o te Buller Westland Publishing Co. Ltd ka mutu te putanga o te “Argus Leader” ki te putanga o tēnei ata nei.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <Essay language="en">
    &lt;p&gt;Sir Donald McLean first proposed a Hawke's Bay newspaper to advocate for 
         provincial separation from Wellington. McLean was one of the first settlers 
         of the fledgling district of Ahuriri, as it was called at the time. Another 
         settler, James Wood, took up the challenge and published the first issue of 
         the Hawke's Bay Herald and Ahuriri Advocate in Napier on 24 September 1857.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;The campaigning for separation was successful and Hawke's Bay became a separate 
         province in 1858. Wood became the official provincial government printer and 
         the Herald also served as the medium for government notices. The "Ahuriri 
         Advocate" part of the paper's title was dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;After first being published weekly, the paper became bi-weekly in 1861. It 
         became a daily in 1871 when Wood sold out to four employees, including William 
         Carlile who had been appointed editor in 1870.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;The Hawke's Bay Weekly Courier was a weekly offshoot of the Herald. It was 
         established in 1879 and lasted until 1897. Both papers survived a disastrous 
         fire that destroyed the Herald offices in 1886.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;A larger newspaper was produced after new machinery was installed in 1926. 
         The Herald strongly advocated for the region's advancement and promoted 
         projects including the Wellington-Napier railway and the construction of 
         water and sewerage systems.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;The February 1931 Napier earthquake spelt the end of the Herald as a separate 
         entity. The quake and subsequent fires completely destroyed the printing plant. 
         The Hastings newspaper, the Hawke's Bay Tribune, took over printing the Herald. 
         In January 1937 the papers merged to form the Hawke's Bay Herald-Tribune, with 
         the last issue of the Herald published on 16 January 1937.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;In 1999 the Hawke's Bay Herald-Tribune was merged with the long-established 
         Napier paper, the Daily Telegraph, to become Hawke's Bay Today.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Nā Te Mākarini (Sir Donald McLean) te whakaaro tuatahi kia tuhia he nūpepa hei whakapāho atu i te kaupapa kia wehe mai te rohe o Kahungunu ki Heretaunga mai i te porowini o Pōneke. Ko Te Mākarini hoki tētahi o ngā tangata tuatahi i noho ki te takiwā hōu i karangatia ko Ahuriri i taua wā.

Ko tētahi o rātau ko William Carlile, ā, ko ia hoki te ētita i whakatūria i te tau 1870.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I te tau 1926 ka riro mai ngā mīhini tā hou, ā, ka puta mai hoki tētahi nūpepa nui kē atu. Ko te mahi a te Herald, he kaha tonu ki te whakaputa i ngā kaupapa hei whakapai i taua rohe nā.

      &lt;p&gt;The Hawke's Bay Weekly Times was the weekly edition of the Hawke's Bay 
        Times, and started on 6 Feb 1865. It contained a summary of the previous 
        week's stories in the Hawke's Bay Times and was intended as a cheap alternative 
        to the daily paper for people living in the isolated rural areas of Hawke's 
        Bay. The paper was published on a Monday costing six pence compared with 
        the Times, which was published three times a week at three pence an issue, 
        therefore saving three pence for subscribers to the weekly edition.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Hawke's Bay Times was first published in 1861 by Yates Brothers Printers. 
        They sold the paper to Thomas Bennick Harding in 1865. It is possible 
        that the weekly edition was part of the new regime under Harding.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Little is known of the Hawke's Bay Times' editorial stance but it appears 
        to have struggled against two other papers, the Hawke's Bay Herald and 
        the Daily Telegraph. The Hawke's Bay Herald had been running since 1857 
        and was the mouthpiece of the landowners while the Daily Telegraph, which 
        began in 1871, represented the region's commercial interests. It seems 
        the Hawke's Bay Times was unable to compete against these two powerful 
        and competing papers, and stopped publishing in 1874.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Hawke's Bay Weekly Times had already stopped publication in December 
        1868 without explanation. It may have been due to poor sales combined 
        with an economic depression that struck the region between 1867 and 1868.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Daily Telegraph had also attempted to produce a weekly edition. However 
        this paper, the Weekly Mercury and Hawke's Bay Advertiser (first published 
        in 1875) also failed due to poor sales and stopped production in 1882.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The paper had a complicated genesis. In Shannon in 1893, William C Nation, well-known in spiritualist circles, began the tri-weekly Manawatu Farmer and Horowhenua County Chronicle, with his son Charles. Nation had previously worked for the Nelson Colonist and the New Zealand Times and had owned the Wairarapa Standard.  In 1896 the well-known newspaper ‘planter’ Joseph Ivess arrived in nearby Levin and began the Manawatu Express and Horowhenua County Advertiser, selling it almost immediately to William J Reid and John McKellop. The Nations responded by moving their plant to Levin, buying in turn the Manawatu Express from Reid and McKellop and absorbing it into the Manawatu Farmer, which continued as a tri-weekly as the town grew. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In 1908 David S Papworth began the short-lived bi-weekly, the Levin Times. This did not survive and Papworth was then briefly manager, editor and reporter of the Manawatu Farmer. In October the same year the Evening Post reported the court case in which Papworth claimed £500 damages (about $34,000 today) from the Horowhenua Publishing Company for wrongful dismissal. The company claimed ‘disloyalty, negligence, and incompetency’; the judge, in awarding £225 to Papworth, suggested the jury might have reasonably taken the view that ‘the company was anxious to sell the property and to get rid of the defendant for the purpose of facilitating the sale’. Ironically, it was Papworth, possibly using some of the money awarded him, who bought the Manawatu Farmer. In 1909, he renamed it the Horowhenua Daily Chronicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Herbert G Kerslake and Robert H Billens were the next owners, buying the paper in 1917. With wartime paper shortages, it was published tri-weekly as the Levin Chronicle until daily publication was resumed in 1923. Before Levin was connected to electricity in 1924 the paper’s printing presses and linotypes were water-powered. The waste waster was piped out to the street gutter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In 1944, L A Humphrey, who began his newspaper career as a Chronicle paper boy in 1920, became a director of what was now Kerslake, Billens and Humphrey. Over the years the Daily Chronicle consolidated its position in Levin and Horowhenua, as the town’s population grew strongly from the 1940s to the 1960s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Kerslake, Billens and Humphrey became, in 1960, part of the United Publishing and Printing Company (UPP), headed by the Rotorua Post’s Ray Smith. Wilson &amp; Horton acquired all the shares in UPP in 1985. A decade later Wilson &amp; Horton, in response to a share raid by Brierley Investments, welcomed the Irish media company Independent Newspapers Plc (INP) as a major shareholder. INP quickly gained control and by April 1998 wholly owned Wilson &amp; Horton. In 2001, INP sold its shareholding to APN News and Media, an Australian media company it partly owned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In early 2007 the Daily Chronicle switched from broadsheet to tabloid format and, interestingly, given subsequent developments, won the 2007 PANPA (Pacific Area Newspaper Publishers’ Association) Newspaper of the Year Award for newspapers of under 15,000 circulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The next year APN announced that the Chronicle was ending six days a week publication and would be distributed free to every household in Levin and surrounding districts, on Wednesday and Saturdays. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; He uaua te whānautanga mai o tēnei pepa. I Shannon i te tau 1893, i tīmataria e William C Nation, he tangata e mōhiotia ana i ngā huinga wairua, me tana tama he niupepa i whakaputaina e toru ngā wā i te wiki, ko te Manawatu Farmer and Horowhenua County Chronicle te ingoa. I mua i te mahi a Nation mō te Nelson Colonist me te New Zealand Times, ko ia hoki te kaipupuri o te Wairarapa Standard mō tētahi wā.  I 1896 i tae atu a Joseph Ivess ki Levin, he tangata rongonui mō te tīmata niupepa, ka tīmata i a ia te Manawatu Express and Horowhenua County Advertiser, ā, poto noa iho te wā i muri mai ka hokona atu anō e ia ki a William J Reid rāua ko John McKellop. Ko te urupare a ngā Nation ko te nuku i tō rātou wheketere ki Taitoko (Levin), me te hoko i te Manawatu Express mai i a Reid rāua ko McKellop, ka tīmataria e rātou te Manawatu Farmer e toru ōna putanga ia wiki i te wā e tupu tonu ana te tāone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  I 1908 ka tīmataria e Davis S Papworth tētahi putanga rua wiki, ko te Levin Times. Kāore i roa ka katia te whakaputanga o tērā, ā, ka riro i a Papworth ngā tūranga o te kaiwhakahaere, te ētita, me te kaipūrongo o te Manawatu Farmer. I te marama o Oketopa o taua tau tonu, i puta te pūrongo i te Evening Post mō tētahi kēhi kōti, arā, ko te whai a Papworth i te utunga £500 (āhua $34,000 i ēnei rā) mai i te Horowhenua Publishing Company ko te pananga hē te take. E ai ki te kamupene, ‘he kōtua, he whakahapa, he koretake hoki’; i te tukuhanga o te £225 ki a Papworth, i puta te huatau a te kaiwhakawā ki te tekau mā rua, tērā pea ko te hiahia a te kamupene ko te hoko i te rawa, me te pana i a Papworth mō te hoko rawa anō te take. Ko te mea korokē, nā Papworth, i runga pea i te moni ka whakawhiwhia ki a ia, i hoko te Manawatu Farmer i 1909 ka hurihia hoki te ingoa ki te Horowhenua Daily Chronicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ko ngā kaipupuri i muri i a ia, ko Herbert G Kerslake rāua ko Robert H Billens, ka hokona e rāua te pepa i 1917.  Nā runga i te korekore o te pepa i waenganui i ngā tau o te pakanga, e toru noa ngā whakaputanga i whakaputaina ia wiki, ko te Levin Chronicle te ingoa tae atu ki 1923 ko te tau tērā i tīmata anō te whakaputa ā-rā. I mua i te tūhononga o Levin ki te hiko i 1924, nā te wai te kaha whakahaere i ngā perehi tā me ngā perehi pato raina (linotype) o te niupepa.  I makina noa te wai para ki te kōrere i te tiriti. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I te tau 1944 ka riro i a L A Humphrey te tūranga o te kaiwhakahaere matua o Kerslake, Billens and Humphrey, nāna i tīmata tana mahi niupepa hei tama pepa mō te Chronicle i te tau 1920. Ka taka ngā tau, ka whakamārōtia e te Daily Chronicle tōna tūranga i Taitoko me te Horowhenua, i te wā e piki kaha haere ana te taupori o te tāone i ngā tau mai i 1940 ki ngā tau o ngā 1960. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  I 1960 ka whakaurua atu a Kerslake, Billens and Humphrey ki te United Publishing and Printing Company (UPP), ko te kaiwhakahaere ko Ray Smith o te Rotorua Post. I 1985 ka riro i a Wilson &amp; Horton ngā hea katoa o UPP.  Tekau tau i muri mai hei urupare i te hokonga o ngā hea maha e Brierley Investments, ka whakatauria tētahi kamupene pāpāho Airihi ko Independent Newspapers Plc (INP) hei kaipupuri hea matua. Kāore e roa ka riro i a INP te mana whakahaere, ā, hei te marama o Āpereira 1998 ka riro katoa a Wilson &amp; Horton i a rātou. I te tau 2001 ka hokona atu e INP ō rātou hea ki a APN News and Media, he kamupene pāpāho, ko rātou tētahi o ana kaipupuri. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I te tīmatanga o 2007 i huri te Daily Chronicle mai i te hōputu rau whānui ki te hōputu hīnohi, ā, he mīharo hoki i runga i ngā whanaketanga o muri mai ka riro i te niupepa te Tohu 2007 PANPA (Pacific Area Newspaper Publishers’ Association) Newspaper of the Year mō ngā niupepa i raro i te 15,000 te tohatohanga. &lt;/p&gt;

  <Description language="en"> The Hutt News is one of New Zealand’s earliest and longest running community newspapers.   It was established by Walter Harold Smith in 1927. Smith, a retired farmer, thought the time was right for Lower Hutt to have its own paper. The neighbouring borough of Petone had managed to sustain a newspaper, the Hutt and Petone Chronicle, since 1887. By the 1920s Lower Hutt’s population was approaching that of Petone’s. </Description>

He kaipāmu o mua a Smith, ā, ki ōna whakaaro kua tae ki te wā e tika ana kia whakaputa a Lower Hutt i tōna ake niupepa.

  <Essay language="en">&lt;p&gt; The Hutt News is one of New Zealand’s earliest and longest running community newspapers.   It was established by Walter Harold Smith in 1927. Smith, a retired farmer, thought the time was right for Lower Hutt to have its own paper. The neighbouring borough of Petone had managed to sustain a newspaper, the Hutt and Petone Chronicle, since 1887. By the 1920s Lower Hutt’s population was approaching that of Petone’s. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt; The Hutt News was first issued in April 1927 under the auspices of the local Businessmen’s Association with 2500 copies posted to households and businesses in Lower Hutt.  In 1928 Smith was joined by James and William Kerr from the Petone Chronicle. Together they formed the Hutt Printing and Publishing Company to produce a new version of the Hutt News. Smith remained as manager with William Kerr assisting him while his brother stayed with the Chronicle. &lt;p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt; The Kerr family had long been involved with newspapers. The father, James Kerr (1834-1901), had worked on papers in Scotland, Australia and Otago before establishing the Grey River Argus in Greymouth in 1865. James, his son, managed the Argus before buying the Petone Chronicle in 1912.  William had worked on the Argus and the New Zealand Times. &lt;p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt; The paper thrived as the population of the area grew rapidly in the 1940s and 1950s although production was threatened during the War due to staff shortages. The Hutt News had to rely on printers from the Trentham Military Camp to keep the paper going. In 1948 William Kerr became the Managing Director after the death of Walter Smith.  &lt;p&gt;  
  &lt;p&gt; In 1953 the Hutt Printing and Publishing Company took over the Petone Chronicle and continued to publish that paper until 1967. In 1961 William Kerr died and his son Ted succeeded him as Managing Director. In 1963 the paper was sold to Blundell Brothers, publishers of the Evening Post. The Hutt News became part of Independent Newspapers Limited (INL) in 1972 after they bought the Blundell’s company. Ownership changed again in 2003 when Fairfax bought INL.  &lt;p&gt;

Nō te taenga ki te tekau tau mai i 1920 kua tata atu te taupori o Lower Hutt ki tō Pitoone. &lt;p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt; I puta te Hutt News tuatahi i te marama o Āperira 1927 i raro i te maru o te rōpū o te Businessmen’s Association o te takiwā, ā, i tukuna ētahi kape 2500 ki ngā kāinga me ngā umanga katoa o Lower Hutt.  Nō te tau 1928 ka uru mai a James rāua ko William Kerr mai i te Petone Chronicle hei hoa mō Smith. I mahi tahi rātou ki te whakatū i te Hutt Printing and Publishing Company ā, ka puta i a ia tētahi putanga hōu o te Hutt News. Ka noho tonu a Smith hei kaiwhakahaere, ko William Kerr te kaiāwhina i a ia, ā, ka noho tonu tana tuakana i te Chronicle. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He roa tonu te mahi a te whānau Kerr i te ao niupepa. I mahi tana matua, a James Kerr (1834-1901), ki ētahi niupepa i Kotirani, i Ahitereiria me Ōtākou i mua i tana whakatūnga i te Grey River Argus i Māwhera i te tau 1865. Nā tana tama, ko James hoki tana ingoa, i whakahaere te Argus i mua i tana hoko i te Petone Chronicle i 1912.  I te mahi a William i te Argus me te New Zealand Times. &lt;p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt; I tino tuawhiti tonu te tupu o te niupepa i te whanaketanga o te takiwā i te tekau tau mai i 1940 me 1950 ahakoa i mōrearea tonu te putanga tonutanga i te Pakanga, nā te kore kaimahi. I riro nā te āwhina o ngā kaitā pukapuka i te Puni Hōia i Trentham i puta tonu ai te Hutt News. Nō te tau 1948 ka eke a William Kerr ki te tūranga Kaihautū Whakahaere i muri i te matenga o Walter Smith.   &lt;p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt; Nō te tau 1953 ka riro i te Hutt Printing and Publishing Company te Petone Chronicle, ā, nāna Te Petone Chronicle i whakaputa tonu, taea noatia te tau 1967. Nō te tau 1961 ka mate a William Kerr ka piki ko tana tama a Ted ki tana tūranga Kaihautū Whakahaere. Nō te tau 1963 ka hokona te niupepa ki Blundell Brothers, ngā kaiwhakaputa o te Evening Post. Ka huri te Hutt News hei wāhi o Independent Newspapers Limited (INL) i te tau 1972, ā, nō muri mai ka hokona e ia te kamupene o ngā Blundell.

		&lt;p&gt;The Hawera &amp; Normanby Star was founded in 1880 by Patrick Galvin, Joseph Innes and J.C. Yorke. Southern Taranaki was being opened up at this time and they saw an opportunity to establish a paper there. All three had worked together on the New Zealand Times in Wellington and their partnership was forged there.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The first issue appeared on 10 April 1880 and the paper was published twice a week. In 1881 Galvin retired due to ill health and his place was taken by Joseph Armit. However Galvin continued to be involved with newspapers for the rest of his life, founding the short-lived Hawera Morning Post in 1894 and contributing to the New Zealand Times. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Star saw off a challenge early on from Joseph Ivess, publisher of the nearby Patea Mail. Ivess had been publishing the Patea Mail since 1875 and had ambitions to establish a chain of papers in Taranaki. He tried to persuade Galvin not to set up in Hawera. When Galvin persisted, he opened an office in Hawera, from which he briefly published the Hawera Times. However the residents of Hawera preferred the Star and Ivess abandoned his new paper after two issues.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Star progressed steadily in its first two decades. In 1882 a new press was installed and the paper began daily publication. In 1885 it started the Egmont Star, a weekly compendium of items from the parent paper for distribution to the backblocks of Taranaki. The Egmont Star ceased in 1914. In 1895 the Hawera Star survived a fire that destroyed the paper's premises and plant.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;In 1889 Yorke became sole proprietor; in 1893 he sold the Star to the paper's editor, William Alfred Parkinson. Parkinson ran the paper until his death in 1920. Ownership changed several more times through the 20th century. The paper ceased daily publication in 1977 and became a community paper the following year. It is still published in that form today.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;I tīmatahia te Hāwera &amp; Normanby Star i te tau 1880 e Patrick Galvin, rātau ko Joseph Innes me J.C. Yorke. I te huaki haerehia te Tonga o Taranaki i taua wā, me tā rātau kite ake i tētahi wāhanga i reira hei whakatū nūpepa. Kua mahia ngātahitia te tokotoru nei i mua i te New Zealand Times i Whanganui-a-Tara, ā, i whakapūmautia tō rātou whakahoatanga i reira.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Nō te 10 o Paenga-whāwhā 1880 te putanga tuatahi, ā, e rua ōna tānga i te wiki. I te tau 1881 ka whakatāngia a Galvin nā tana pāngia e te mate, ā, ka riro tōna tūranga i a Joseph Armit. Engari i noho tonu a Galvin ki roto i ngā whakarite o ngā nūpepa mō te roanga atu o tōna oranga, ā, nāna i tīmata te nūpepa Hāwera Morning Post i te tau 1894, ahakoa poto noa iho te wā ki tēnei pepa, me te whai wāhi anō ki te New Zealand Times.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I te tīmatanga i parea atu e te Star te wero a Joseph Ivess, te kaitā i te nūpepa tata mai, te Patea Mail. E tāhia ana e Ivess te Patea Mail i te tau 1875 me tana hiahia ki te whakatū i ētahi nūpepa ki roto o Taranaki. I whakamātau ia ki te aukati i a Galvin mai i Hāwera. Nā te ngana haere tonu o Galvin, ka whakatūhia e ia he tari ki Hāwera, i reira ka tāhia te Hāwera Times mō te wā poto. Engari i hiahia kē ngā tāngata o Hāwera ki te Star, ā, e rua ngā putanga o tēnei nūpepa ka mutu.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Pai tonu te haere o te Star i ngā tau rua tekau mai i tōna tīmatanga. I te tau 1882 ka whakauruhia he mīhini tā hou, ā, ka tāhia te nūpepa nei ia rangi. I te tau 1885 ka tīmatahia te Egmont Star, ā, puta ai tēnei nūpepa ia wiki me ngā pitopito kōrero mai i te nūpepa matua hei tohatoha atu ki ngā wāhi tuawhenua o Taranaki. I katia te Egmont Star i te tau 1914. I te tau 1895 i ora noa te Hawera Star i tētahi kāpura i turakina ai te wāhi me ngā rawa o te nūpepa.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I te tau 1889 ka noho ko Yorke te rangatira ake; i te tau 1893 ka hokona atu e ia te Star ki tōna kaietita, a William Alfred Parkinson. Whakahaerehia e Parkinson te pepa nei tae noa ki tōna matenga i te tau 1920. He maha tonu ngā whakawhititanga o te pepa nei i roto i ngā tau o te rautau 20. Whakamutuhia te tānga ia rangi o tēnei nūpepa i te tau 1977, ā, ka huri hei pepa hapori i te tau o muri mai. Tāhia tonutia hei pepa hapori i ēnei rā.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Essay language="en">
    &lt;p&gt;The Inangahua Times was published in Reefton from 1875 until it ceased 
        publication in 1942. Initially it was issued three times a week, but by 1891 
        it came out daily. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Times was started by William Joseph Potts. Potts had been involved 
        with other newspapers on the West Coast. In 1873 he had edited Grey Valley 
        Times at Ahaura. In 1874 he started the Reefton Courier but this didn't 
        last out the year. Potts owned the Times until his death in 1901. His 
        wife ran the paper after his death.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Times had to compete with several other newspapers in Reefton. The 
        main rival was the Inangahua Herald which had begun three years before 
        the Times in 1872. The Times eventually absorbed the Herald in 1936.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In 1888 Reefton got a third daily newspaper, the Reefton Guardian. Reefton's 
        population at this time was about 2,000 which was not enough to support 
        three newspapers. The Guardian was the first to go under, probably in 
        1894.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It's not clear why a small town like Reefton had three daily newspapers. 
        Certainly the 1890s was a flourishing time for newspaper publishing in 
        New Zealand (newspaper publication peaked about 1910). Also it's likely 
        that Reefton was seen as a town with prospects. Reefton was known as the 
        "Gateway to the Coast" because most land traffic in and out 
        of the West Coast passed through it. It had been a boom town in the 1860s 
        and 1870s. In 1887 Reefton became the first place in New Zealand to have 
        its own public electricity supply and in 1892 it was connected by rail 
        to Greymouth.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Times, like many other small town newspapers in New Zealand, could 
        not cope with the restrictions and shortages that the Second World War 
        brought and it published its last issue on 6 June 1942.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Times was revived as a weekly in 1946 under the title Inangahua-Murchison 
        Times. This paper ceased in 1956.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ka tāngia te Inangahua Times i Reefton mai te tau 1875 tae noa ki tana katinga i te tau 1942. I te tīmatanga e toru ōna putanga ia wiki, nō te tau 1891, ka puta ai ia rā.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nā William Joseph Potts te Times i tīmata. He pānga anō o Potts ki ētahi atu o ngā nūpepa o Te Tai Poutini. Koia te ētita o te Grey Valley Times i Ahaura i te tau 1873. I te tau 1874 nāna te Reefton Courier i tīmata, engari kāore i pau noa te tau ka katia ai. Ko Potts te rangatira o te Times tae noa ki tana mate i te tau 1901. Nō muri mai nā tana wahine i whakahaere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He tāwhainga nō te Times i ētahi atu nūpepa maha i Reefton. Ko te tāwhainga matua nō te Inangahua Herald ko tōna tīmatanga e toru tau nō mua noa o te Times i te tau 1872. Ka horomia rawatia te Herald e te Times i te tau 1936.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nō te tau 1888, ka puta ai te tuatoru o ngā nūpepa ia rā o Reefton, te Reefton Guardian. Ko te tokomaha i Reefton i taua wā he 2,000 pea, kāore i taea te tautoko i ngā nūpepa e toru. Ko te Guardian te tuatahi kia taka, i te tau 1894 pea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kāore i te mārama he aha i toru ai ngā nūpepa i te tāone pēnei me Reefton. Ko te tekau tau atu i 1890 he wā makuru mō te tā nūpepa i Niu Tīreni (ko tōna taumata i te tau 1910 pea). Tērā pea i tūmanakotia ko Reefton tētahi tāone tōnui. I mōhiotia whānuitia hei 'Kūaha ki Te Tai Poutini' i te mea mā reira te nuinga o ngā haerenga mai me ngā haerenga atu o Te Tai Poutini. He tāone tuputere i ngā tau mai i 1860 ki te 1880. I te tau 1887 ko Reefton te wāhi tuatahi o Niu Tīreni kia whiwhi ki tōna ake whakaratonga hiko ki te iwi whānui, ā, nō te tau 1892 ka honoa ai ki Māwhera (Greymouth) mā te rerewē.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ka rite te Times ki te maha noa o ngā nūpepa o ngā tāone iti o te motu, kāore i ora mai i ngā haukotinga me ngā kōpaka o te Pakanga Tuarua o te Ao, ā, ko tōna putanga whakamutunga i te 6 o Hune o te tau 1942.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I whakaoratia mai anō te Times hei nūpepa ia-wiki i te tau 1946, ko te ingoa ko te Inangahua-Murchison Times. Nō te tau 1956 ka katia ai.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Because European occupation and development of the King Country came much later than most other parts of New Zealand, newspapers also came relatively late to the area. The King Country was the heart of the Maori King movement, in parts still strongly antagonistic to European settlement, so it was not until the main truck railway line pushed through the area that towns developed. The railway from Auckland reached Te Kuiti, a Maori village, in 1887. European settlement dates from that year, when a railway construction camp was established, including an iron foundry to make girders for the Waiteti Viaduct. The main trunk line slowly extended south, reaching Taumarunui in 1901. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; It has been claimed that, at the beginning of the 20th century, there were 134 Europeans in Te Kuiti but the completion of the rail link brought in more settlers, the beginning of pastoral farming and cutting down of dense forests. The weekly King Country Chronicle was launched in Te Kuiti in 1906 by Arthur Hayward and Norman Matthews. The Poverty Bay Herald announced in its 2 November issue that the new paper ‘is excellently got up and has a substantial look’. Hayward left shortly afterwards, and edited the New Zealand Farmer in Auckland until his death in 1914. Matthews continued to run the paper for a number of years. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In the early years of settlements, newspapers saw ‘boosterism’ – the boosting and often exaggerated promotion of their communities as a key role. When Te Kuiti became a borough in 1910, the King Country Chronicle published this doggerel:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 20px&quot;&gt; ‘Ho, Te Kuiti has a Mayor&lt;br /&gt; Say the word and hold your breath&lt;br /&gt; From the Waipa right to Taupo&lt;br /&gt; She’s the greatest and the best&lt;br /&gt; From the great majestic river&lt;br /&gt; That all nations flock to see&lt;br /&gt; Westward to the rolling hills&lt;br /&gt; Te Kuiti is the town to be.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;  By 1911, the European population of the King Country was just over 15,000. Te Kuiti and Taumarunui were the largest towns, each with about 1,000 Europeans. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;  In May 1918, the New Zealand Herald announced that the Waikato Times Publishing Company and Mr W Thomas, proprietor of the Taumarunui Press, had joined interests and taken over the King Country Chronicle. ‘The business of the three papers will be run in the name of the Waikato and King Country Press’. The agreement was either very short-lived or never finalised because the next year Matthews sold the King Country Chronicle to John Hamill.  His ownership was not without its difficulties. In December 1921 Hamill was the defendant in a Hamilton Supreme Court case, sued for £4,000 by the clerk of the Waitomo County Council, who alleged libel. It was decided the statements published in the King Country Chronicle were defamatory and £50 damages were awarded. The next year the paper was sold again, this time to Samuel Craig, member of an Invercargill printing and publishing family that part-owned the Southland News. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;  The King Country Chronicle was subsequently a bi-weekly run in conjunction with the Otorohanga Times (1912), which was begun by ‘rag-planter’ J H Claridge and later purchased by the Craigs. In 1980 the King Country Chronicle and Otorohanga Times were merged. The Waitomo News, as the resulting newspaper was named, was sold to the Spring family in 2002. The free tabloid, delivered on Tuesdays and Thursdays, is part of the Spring’s privately-owned group which includes the Whakatane Beacon, Bay Weekender and Opotiki News. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Nā runga i te tōmuri o te tae mai a te iwi Pākehā me ōna āhuatanga whanake ki te Rohe Pōtae, i tōmuri ai te tae mai o ngā nūpepa Pākehā ki tēnei o ngā rohe. Ko te Rohe Pōtae te pūtahi o te Kīngitanga, ā, i ētahi takiwā ōna kāore rawa atu ōna hapū i rata ki te Pākehā kia nohonoho i reira. Nō te taenga mai o te rerewē kātahi anō ka tae mai te ararino, ka tupu mai ai ko ngā tāone a te Pākehā i te taha. Ka tae te rerewē mai i Tāmaki-makau-rau ki  Te Kuiti, tētehi kāinga Maori, i te tau 1887. I tīmata te nohonoho mai a te Pākehā i taua tau i te whakatūnga o tētehi puni hanga rerewē, tae atu ki tētahi whare whakarewa rino hanga tāhuhu mō te piriti o te Waitetī. Ka toro whaka-te-tonga te ararino matua o te motu, tae rawa atu ki Taumarunui i te tau 1901. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; E ai ki ngā kōrero a ētahi, i te tīmatanga o te rau tau 20, 134 ngā Pākehā i te noho i Te Kuiti ā, nō te otinga o te hononga rerewē i piki ake ai te maha o ngā tāngata nohonoho i reira, i tīmata ai hoki te whāngai kararehe, me te tuatua i Te Wao nui a Tāne. I whakarewaina te nūpepa ā-wiki nei te King Country Chronicle i Te Kuiti i te tau 1906 e Arthur Hayward rāua ko Norman Matthews. E ai ki ngā kōrero a te Poverty Bay Herald i tōna putanga o te 2 Nōema ko te nūpepa hou ‘he ātaahua te takoto, he whai kiko ki te titiro atu’. Kāore i roa i muri mai ka wehe atu a Hayward ka haere hei kaiwhakatika i te New Zealand Farmer i Tāmaki-makau-rau taea noatia tōna matenga i te tau 1914. I whakahaere a Matthews i te nūpepa mō ētahi tau i muri mai. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I ngā tau tuatahi o ngā tāone hou ko te ‘whakarawe’ – arā, te whakarawe me te whakapai i ngā āhuatanga o ō rātou tāone tētahi whāinga nui mā ngā nūpepa o aua tāone. Nō te ekenga o Te Kuiti hei takiwā 'borough' i te tau 1910, ka whakaputaina e te King Country Chronicle tēnei ruriruri: &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 20px&quot;&gt; ‘E, he koromatua tō Te Kuiti&lt;br /&gt; Whakapuakina te kupu takina te manawa&lt;br /&gt; Mai i Waipā tae noa ki Taupō&lt;br /&gt; Koia anō te mea rahi rawa, te mea hira rawa&lt;br /&gt; Mai i te awa rongonui&lt;br /&gt; Te mīharotanga a ngā whenua o te ao&lt;br /&gt; Ahu whaka-te-uru ki ngā pīnanakitanga&lt;br /&gt; Ko Te Kuiti ia te tāone ka manakohia.’ &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Nō te taenga ki te tau 1911, kua piki iti ake te taupori o te Rohe Pōtae i te 15,000. Ko Te Kuiti me Taumarunui ngā tāone nunui rawa,  1,000 nga Pākehā o tētehi, o tētehi. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;  I te marama o Mei 1918, ka whakapuakina e te New Zealand Herald kua tūhono te Waikato Times Publishing Company rāua ko W Thomas, te rangatira o te Taumarunui Press, i ō rātou hea, ā, kua noho tahi hei rangatira mō te King Country Chronicle. ‘Ka whakahaeretia ngā kaipakihi o ngā nūpepa e toru i raro i te ingoa te Waikato and King Country Press’. Heoi anō, he poto noa iho te wā o te kirimana, kāore i oti mārire rānei, inā hoki, i te tau i muri ka hokona te King Country Chronicle ki a John Hamill.  Ehara i te mea kāore he raruraru o tōna wā i te nūpepa. Nō te marama o Tīhema 1921  ko Hamill te tangata e whakapaetia ana i tētahi take ki te Kōti Teitei o Kirikiriroa mō te £4,000 he mea whakapae e te Waitomo County Council, mō te hāhani. Ka whakatauria, āe, he hāhani tonu ngā kupu i puta i te King Country Chronicle me te whakawhiwhi i ngā moni kāpeneheihana £50. I te tau i muri mai ka hokona anō te nūpepa, ki Samuel Craig, he mema nō tētahi whānau tā-nūpepa, tā-pukapuka nō Te Waihōpai, nō rātou tētahi wāhi o te Southland News. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;  I muri i tērā, e rua ngā putanga o te King Country Chronicle i te wiki, i te taha o te  Otorohanga Times (1912), nā tētehi ‘rag-planter’ nā J H Claridge i tīmata, ā, i hokona i muri e te whānau Craig. I te tau 1980 ka whakakotahitia te King Country Chronicle me te Otorohanga Times. Ko te nūpepa i hua ake ka whakaingoatia ko te Waitomo News, ā, ka hokona ki te whānau Spring i te tau 2002. He nūpepa whāiti kore-utu tēnei i tohangia i ngā Tūrei me ngā Tāite. He wāhi tēnei nō te huinga nūpepa tūmataiti a Spring kei roto nei te  Whakatane Beacon, Bay Weekender me Opotiki News. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Kai Tiaki - the Journal of the Nurses of New Zealand, as it was originally titled, was founded by the indomitable nursing visionary Hester Maclean, who came to New Zealand from Australia in 1906 to take up the government role of Assistant Inspector of Hospitals.  In this role, she had oversight of all nursing matters. Using her own funds and working in her own time, she established Kai Tiaki, first published in January 1908. The quarterly publication cost the princely sum of four shillings a year. In her inaugural editorial on the purposes of the journal, Maclean said she wanted it to be  ‘. . . a bond of union, a common interest,  a means of communication, a mutual help, and a road to improvement in their professional work and knowledge, to all nurses of the Dominion . . .’   &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; Maclean chose the title, wanting it to be distinctive and suggestive of the journal’s country of origin. It was suggested to her by a Government interpreter, in response to a request from Maclean.  Kai tiaki, in Māori, contains meanings associated with guardianship and protection. The journal has undergone a number of name changes but, despite its official titles, it has always been referred to by the profession at large, as simply Kai Tiaki. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; It was first registered as a magazine in 1912. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Maclean maintained ownership of the journal, which reported extensively on nurses’ involvement in World War 1 and on the influenza epidemic of 1918, in which more than 8000 New Zealanders, including some 30 nurses, died. In 1919 a complete set of journals covering the period of the First World War, 1914-1918, was deposited in the British War Museum in London. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In 1923, the New Zealand Trained Nurses’ Association (NZTNA), founded in 1909, bought Kai Tiaki from Maclean, who remained as editor. The journal subscription increased to six shillings a year. The following year the first sub-editor was appointed, and in 1930 Kai Tiaki expanded to become a bi-monthly publication. That year also saw a name change to New Zealand Nursing Journal (Kai Tiaki). &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; In 1932 Maclean, the journal’s founder and editor for 24 years, died. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; From 1939 to 1947 Kai Tiaki was published monthly but in 1942 wartime regulations controlling the use of newsprint saw the number of pages in each issue reduced to 28, then 24. From 1947 to 1959, Kai Tiaki was published two monthly, returning to monthly publication at the dawn of the new decade. 1957 was literally a red letter day for the journal, when it used colour on its cover for the first time and 1958 saw the publication of a Golden Jubilee issue. Kai Tiaki continued to be published monthly until 1988, when publication was reduced to 11 times a year, with a combined December/January issue. &lt;/p&gt;

Nā tēnei tūranga ko tāna he mātai i ngā take nēhi.  Mai i tāna ake pūtea, he mea mahi i tōna ake wā hoki, nāna te Kai Tiaki i whakatū, ko te tānga tuatahi i te Hānuere o 1908.  Ko te utu nanakia o te tānga ia toru marama he whā hereni i te tau.  I tāna etitatanga tuatahi mō ngā kaupapa o te hautaka, ko tā Mackean he hiahia nōna ko te hautaka ‘ … hei pou here i ngā nēhi katoa o te Tōminiona, hei hurahi whakawhitiwhitinga whakaaro ngātahi, ka whakapakarihia ai te ngaio o ā rātou mahi, mātauranga hoki ...’ &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Nā Maclean te ingoa, ko tāna hiahia ki te ingoa motuhake, he mea whai hoki i te whenua taketake.  Nā tētahi kaiwhakamāori Kāwanatanga i tūtohu mai, hei whai i tā Maclean tono.  Ko te Kai tiaki he mea pā ki te mānaakitanga me te poipoitanga.  Kua whakarerekēhia te ingoa i roto i te wā ēngari, ahakoa ōna ingoa ōkawa, ko tōna ingoa ōpaki tonu ki tōna hunga ngaio, ko te Kai Tiaki noa.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; He mea rehita hei puka maheni i te 1912. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ka mau tonu i a Maclean te rangatiratanga o te hautaka, he pūrongo nui o te whai wāhi a te hunga nēhi i te Pakanga Tuatahi, me te tahumāero whurū o te 1918, otirā te matenga o te neke atu i te 8000 tāngata o Aotearoa, tae atu ki te 30 nēhi hoki. I te 1919, ka takohatia tētahi huinga katoa o te hautaka o te 1914-1918, te Pakanga Tuatahi, ki te British War Museum i Rānana. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I te 1923 nā te New Zealand Trained Nurses’ Association (NZTNA), he mea whakaū i te 1909, te Kai Tiaki i hoko mai i a Maclean, me tāna noho tonu hei etita.  Ka rahi ake te utu ki te ono hereni i te tau.  Nō te tau o muri mai ka whakatūria tōna etita-tautoko tuatahi. I te 1930, ka tāngia rua-maramatia. I taua tau anō ka huria te ingoa ki te New Zealand Nursing Journal (Kai Tiaki). &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Nō te 1932, ka mate ai a Maclean, tōna kaiwhakaū, tōna etita  mō te 24 tau. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Mai i te 1939 ki te 1947 he mea tā ia marama te Kai Tiaki, ēngari nā ngā ture pakanga o te whakamahi pepa ka iti iho ia tānga ki te 28 whārangi, kātahi ki te 24.  Mai i te 1947 ki te 1959, ka tāngia ia rua-marama, ka hoki ki te tānga ia marama i te pūaotanga o te tekautau hōu.  He ‘rā reta-whero’ tūturu te 1957 mōna, kātahi rā ka kitea tuatahitia ngā tae ki tōna uwhi. Nō te 1958, ko te whakaputanga o tōna tānga Rima Tekau Tau.

    &lt;p&gt;  In 1905, Charles de La Roche started the weekly Kaipara Advertiser and Waitemata Chronicle in Helensville. &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;  A 41-year-old entrepreneur, de La Roche was born and grew up in New South Wales. At 21 he was an officer in the Australian Imperial Forces and served in the Sudan War in 1885. Several years later he resigned his commission and moved to New Zealand. Already an experienced journalist, he contributed to a number of South Auckland  newspapers while establishing a real estate business at Pukekohe.  &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;  He launched his first newspaper, the Tauranga Herald, in 1899, but the bi-weekly survived for only a few months. His next venture, the Rodney and Otamatea Times, based in Warkworth, was to prove much more successful. Late in 1903 he sold the newspaper, moved his real estate business to Helensville and established his third newspaper. &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;  Helensville had been settled in 1863 by Scottish timber millers and kauri milling underwrote the town’s early development, with dairy farming of increasing importance by the beginning of the 20th century. &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;  The Kaipara Advertiser and Waitemata Chronicle had several more owners before Francis Mackenzie absorbed the paper into his Kaipara and Waitemata Echo in 1914. The Echo began publishing in 1907 and the new weekly was soon outperforming its competitor. Mackenzie, a colourful newspaperman who started several Northland newspapers, had worked for the Government Printer in Sydney and was an overseer at Auckland’s Southern Cross before founding his most successful publication, the Northern Luminary, in Kawakawa in 1879. He sold this paper in 1913. Known for the robustness of his journalism he was taken to court for libel and was once attacked in the street by someone claiming he had been defamed. Son Frank took over the Echo when his father died in 1917 and ran it until he retired.  C J Claridge, junior, owned the paper until 1927 and then sold to Hilton Venables. The Echo was subsequently incorporated into the Rodney and Otamatea Courier. &lt;p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;  Nō te 1905, nā Charles de La Roche i tīmata te wikiri nei te Kaipara Advertiser and Waitemata Chronicle i Helensville. &lt;p&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;  He tangata tīmata pakihi a de La Roche,  41 ōna tau, i whānau mai, i tupu ake hoki i New South Wales. 21 ōna tau ka eke hei āpiha i te Ope Taua o Ahitereiria, ka haere ki te Pakanga i Sudan i te tau 1885. Ētahi tau i muri mai ka tukua e ia tana kōmihana ka nuku mai ki Aotearoa. Kua tautōhito kē ia ki ngā mahi kawe kōrero, ā, i riro nāna i tuhi kōrero mō ētahi o ngā niupepa o Manukau, o Pukekohe i a ia e whakatū ana i tētahi umanga hoko kāinga hoko whenua i Pukekohe. &lt;p&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;  Ka whakarewaina e ia tana niupepa tuatahi, te Tauranga Herald, i te tau 1899, engari i ora mai te niupepa rua-putanga-i-te-wiki mō ētahi marama noa iho. Otiia ko tana umanga o muri mai, te Rodney and Otamatea Times, i puta rā i Warkworth, tērā noa ake te painga i puta. No ngā marama whakamutunga o 1903 ka hokona e ia te niupepa, ka nekehia e ia tana umanga hoko whenua, hoko kāinga ki Helensville, ka whakatūria hoki e ia tana niupepa tuatoru. &lt;p&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;  Kua whakanohonoho mai ngā kaituatua rākau, kaimira kauri mai i Kotirani ki Helensvillei te tau 1863, nā rātou anō i punga te whanaketanga o te tāone i aua tau tuatahi, ā, i te takanga o ngā tau ka piki hoki te hua o te mahi pāmu kau kūtētē kia tae ki te tīmatanga o te rau tau 20. &lt;p&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;  Arā anō ngā rangatira o te Kaipara Advertiser and Waitemata Chronicle i mua i te rironga o te niupepa i a Francis Mackenzie ki roto i tāna Kaipara and Waitemata Echo i te tau 1914. I tīmata te puta o te Echo i te tau 1907, ā, kāore i roa i muri mai ka kaha ake tāna mahi i tōna hoa tauwhāinga. He kaihautū niupepa ingoa-nui a Mackenzie, i riro nāna i tīmata ētahi niupepa o Te Tai Tokerau. I mahi ia mō te Kaitā Kāwanatanga i Poihākena, ā, he kaiārahi ia i te Southern Cross o Tāmaki-makaurau i mua i tāna whakatūranga i tōna niupepa tino whai painga rawa, te Northern Luminary, i Kawakawa i 1879.

    &lt;p&gt; Even before the arrival of the first colonists in Canterbury, they had highlighted the need for a newspaper: a “Prospectus of Newspaper to be established in the Canterbury Settlement” proposed the publication of a weekly newspaper to be called the Lyttelton Times. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The plant arrived in Lyttelton on 16 December 1850 on the Charlotte Jane, one of the first four ships. The first issue was published on the 11 January 1851, under the editorship of James Edward Fitzgerald. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Lyttelton Times began to appear twice a week in 1854, then in 1863 this increased to three times a week. At this time, publication also moved to Christchurch, already home to The Press newspaper, founded in 1861. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The publishers of the Lyttelton Times started the weekly Canterbury Times in 1865, and then The Star, an evening edition of the Lyttelton Times, appeared on 14 May 1868. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In 1929 the Lyttelton Times became the Christchurch Times, the final issue of which appeared on 29 June 1935. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Lyell, in the South Island’s Buller district, was a major producer of gold and the centre of considerable quartz mining activity in the surrounding hills until the mid 1890s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Gold was first discovered in the area by Maori prospectors in the early 1860s. As word spread of their finds, miners arrived from other fields and overseas. The only access was by canoe on the Buller River with its many rapids and it was some years before a road was built along the banks of the Buller Gorge. Cliff Street, Lyell’s only street, where its banks, hotels and newspaper were located, was constructed in the 1870s. By then, the wives and families of miners had arrived, tents along Lyell Creek were replaced by houses around Cliff Street and a more settled community flourished until it had a population of more than 2,000 in the late 1880s. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The first newspaper, the Lyell Argus and Matakitaki Advertiser, launched in 1873, was published weekly, and for a time twice weekly. Its four pages carried international and local news, particularly mining developments and advertisements for the growing number of retailers along Cliff Street.  It was run by James Graham Niven and later by Thomas John Metcalfe. It closed in 1882, very likely because of the arrival of a competitor. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Lyell Times and Central Buller Gazette was begun in 1881 by Edward Percy Smyrk. He had served an apprenticeship under John Tyrrell, then owner of the Westport Times, before working on the Inangahua Times in Reefton.  After Smyrk sold the Lyell Times to Walter Atkin in 1888 he worked on the Westport Times again. Later, as proprietor of the short-lived Gisborne newspaper the New Zealand Standard, he filed for bankruptcy in 1892, with liabilities of £349, more than three times his available assets. Interestingly, among his debtors were two well-known newspapermen, Henry Brett and William G Geddis. He subsequently worked on Hawke’s Bay newspapers. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Walter Atkin, originally from Ireland, had managed the Inangahua Times before taking over the Lyell Times. In 1896, the paper’s Cliff Street office was victim of a major fire that also destroyed the National Bank, three hotels and a number of other buildings. Few of the businesses were insured, but Atkin was covered for £200. With the township badly affected by the fire, Atkin closed the Lyell Times a couple of years later and purchased the Westport News, a morning daily.  Unlike many early newspaper proprietors he left a sizeable estate – £2,326 – on his death in 1911. (About $375,000 today.) &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Lyell recovered to some degree from the 1896 fire, but the closure of the area’s largest mine a decade later led to a major exodus of residents. A number of surviving buildings were destroyed by another fire in 1926 and most of those still living there left after the 1929 Murchison earthquake. Today the cemetery and a picnic ground with display boards outlining the area’s history are all that remain. &lt;/p&gt;

I hangaia tōna tiriti kotahi anake, te tiriti o Cliff , Lyell i te tekau tau mai i 1870. I reira ngā pēke, ngā hōtēra me te tari nūpepa o te tāone. Nō te taenga ki tērā wā, kua taetae mai ngā wāhine me ngā whānau o ngā kaikeri, ā, kua ngaro ngā tēneti i te taha o Lyell Creek, me te tū mai o ngā whare i te Tiriti o Cliff. Ka tupu mai he hapori āhua toitū, ā, ka piki te taupori kia neke atu i te 2,000 i ngā tau mai i 1886 ki 1890. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I whakarewaina te nūpepa tuatahi, te Lyell Argus and Matakitaki Advertiser, i te tau 1873, ā, kotahi putanga i te wiki, ā, i muri e rua ngā putanga i te wiki mō tētahi wā.

    &lt;p&gt; I tīmataria te Lyell Times and Central Buller Gazette i te tau 1881 e Edward Percy Smyrk. I akoako ia i raro i a John Tyrrell, te rangatira i taua wā o te Westport Times, i mua i tana mahi i te Inangahua Times i Rīwhitana.  I muri i te hokonga a Smyrk i te Lyell Times ki a Walter Atkin i te tau 1888 i mahi anō ia i teWestport Times. Nō muri mai, hei rangatira o te nūpepa o Tūranga nui a Kiwa e mōhiotia ko te New Zealand Standard ka tono ia ki te kōti pēkerapu i te tau 1892. Ko ngā nama i eke ki te £349, e toru whakareanga tēnei o āna rawa. He mea anō, i waenga i ōna hoa noho nama ki a ia tokorua ngā kaimahi nūpepa, a Henry Brett rāua ko William G Geddis. Nō muri ka mahi ia i ētahi nūpepa i te Matau a Māui.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Kua whakahaeretia e Walter Atkin, mai i Airani i mua, te Inangahua Times i mua i tana whakahaere i te Lyell Times. I te tau 1896, ka wera te tari o te nūpepa i te Tiriti o Cliff i te ahi, nāna hoki i kai te Pēke National, ngā hōtēra e toru me ētahi atu whare. He iti noa ngā umanga i inihuatia engari i te inihuatia a Atkin mō te £200. I tino kino te raru o te tāone i te ahi, ā, ka kati a Atkin i te Lyell Times ā, e rua tau ki muri ka huri ki te hoko i teWestport News, he nūpepa ata ā-rā.  Kāore i rite ki ētahi atu rangatira nūpepa o aua tau tuatahi, arā, ka waiho e ia ētahi moni nui ki ana uri - £2,326 – i tōna matenga i te tau 1911.

    &lt;p&gt; Following the discovery of gold on the banks of the Shotover River in November 1862, the town of Queenstown appeared almost overnight and the first issue of the Lake Wakatip Mail followed soon after on 2 May 1863. The Otago Daily Times of 18 May 1863 commented about the Mail that ‘it seems difficult to realise ... that such a paper should be published in Queenstown, a place which six months ago was the head station of a runholder, and nothing more’. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; James Bradshaw, who later achieved prominence as a Member of Parliament and as an important early advocate of labour law reform, worked as an editor of the Mail. However, the key figure in the early life of the paper was William Warren, who became part owner of the paper in 1864 and sole owner in 1867. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; When gold was discovered on the West Coast, many miners moved on, and the Mail struggled to survive in the severe slump that followed. In April 1867 the Mail announced it would cease publication but was revived after missing only one issue. In its early years, flood and fire also added to the Mail’s difficulties. In 1878 the lower part of Queenstown was flooded and the Mail’s stock damaged; worse was to follow in 1879 when two of Warren’s children lit some paper and the Mail’s office was completely destroyed by fire, along with a supply of new type and materials that had only been received from Melbourne the previous day. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In 1883 Warren found himself in legal strife after the Mail published a scathing article about a public address by J T Marryat Hornsby of the neighbouring Arrowtown newspaper, the Lake County Press. Hornsby sued for damages for libel and succeeded when the jury held that the Mail had implied that Hornsby was a convict by saying he came from Tasmania. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; After William Warren died the Warren family continued to be involved with the Mail for many years. During the First World War, Margaret (Daisy) Warren took over management of the paper when her brother enlisted for service, despite prejudice and doubt over her suitability for the role. Daisy proved to be highly successful in her new position and after the war continued to have a prominent role in the running of the Mail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;  In 1928 the Lake Wakatip Mail absorbed the Lake County Press and continued to be published until 6 February 1947. &lt;/p&gt;

I puta te kī a te Otago Daily Times i te 18 Mei 1863 mō te Mail, pēnei "he uaua hopu a te hinengaro ... i tēnei āhua, kia tū he nūpepa pēnei i Queenstown, he takiwā tēnei he teihana pāmu matua noa iho nā tētahi kaipupuru whenua, kāore kau atu i reira e ono marama ki muri’.&lt;/p&gt;

I te marama o Āperira 1867 ka puta te kī a te Mail ka mutu tāna puta ki te ao engari i whakaorangia mai anō i muri i te hapanga kotahi. I ōna tau tuatahi, nā te waipuke, nā te kānga hoki o te ahi i haupū ai he uauatanga mō te Mail. I te tau 1878 ka waipuketia te wāhanga o raro o Queenstown me te raru anō o ngā rawa o te Mail; engari he kino kē atu te aitua i whai i muri i te tau 1879. Nā ētahi tamariki tokorua a Warren i tahu pepa, ā, ka toro te ahi, kainga katoatia ana te tari o te Mail e te ahi, tae atu ki ngā pūranga poraka tā me ngā rawa kātahi anō ka tae mai i Poipiripi i te rā o mua atu. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1883 ka taka a Warren ki tētahi raruraru ā-ture i tāna whakaputanga i tētahi tuhinga whiu kōrero i te Mail mō tētahi kauwhau tūmatanui nā J T Marryat Hornsby nō te nūpepa o te tāonga tūtata o Arrowtown nō te Lake County Press. I hāmene a Hornsby i a ia mō ngā tūkinotanga i te tuhinga, ā i eke tana whakapae i te kitenga a te tekau mā rua nā te Mail i whakairi te whakaaro he mauhere a Hornsby nā te mea i ahu mai ia i Tasmania. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I muri i te matenga o William Warren i haere tonu te mahi tahitanga a te whānau Warren ki ngā mahi te Mail mō ngā tau maha rawa. I roto i te Pakanga Tuatahi o Te Ao nā te tuahine o Warren nā Margaret (Daisy) Warren i whakahaere te nūpepa i te urunga o tana tungāne ki ngā ope hōia, ahakoa ngā whakaaro kino me ngā āwangawanga mō tana tōtika mō te tūnga. Ka tino eke ngā mahi katoa o te nūpepa i a Daisy ā, i muri i te pakanga i haere tonu tana mahi ki te whakahaere i te Mail. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; The Maoriland Worker is widely considered the most important publication of the New Zealand labour movement. Early in the 20th century the labour movement had two main strands – those wanting revolution and those working for reform and both had publications reflecting their views. Militant trade unionists did not fit easily into either camp. The Shearers’ Union in Christchurch felt the full weight of press condemnation after a 1910 wage dispute and decided to begin their own paper, The Maoriland Worker, as a monthly. The newspaper was produced in Christchurch for a short period, with Ettie Rout and Alexander Wildey prominent.  When the shearers’ and miners’ unions combined forces, the paper now represented the ‘Red’ Federation of Labour and, early in 1911, moved its publishing office to Wellington. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The paper, now a weekly, grew rapidly in circulation and influence under the editorship of Australian Bob Ross. It had a circulation of 8,500 by 1912 and 10,000 by the beginning of the next year. It was at the centre of the Federation’s push for socialism. Unionists were enthusiastic ‘paper boys’ and there was a network of voluntary correspondents around the country. The Maoriland Worker’s editorial policy was firmly behind industrial unionism, international co-operation among unionists and pacifism.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Maoriland Worker was produced to a high professional standard and included some of the most penetrating political cartoons of the period.  Ross had left by 1913, and his replacement, Harry Holland, was later leader of the Labour Party. Holland was charged with sedition for his coverage of a waterfront dispute that snowballed into a general strike late in 1913. He was sentenced to a year in prison, and served a little over three months. When war broke out shortly afterwards, the Maoriland Worker took an uncompromising international socialist position and Holland editorialised that world revolution was at hand. He left the paper in 1918 when elected to Parliament at a by-election. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The weekly continued to express its radical views through the war years and until the early 1920s. During the First World War it struggled with libel costs, censorship and police harassment. In October 1921 The Maoriland Worker carried two poems by the noted British war poet Siegfried Sassoon.  Three lines of ‘Stand to: Good Friday Morning’ attracted the attention of the authorities and the paper’s publisher was charged with ‘blasphemous libel’. John Glover was tried in the Supreme Court in 1922, still the only such case in NZ legal history. The trial was held at a time when any dissent was suppressed wherever possible and politicians were preoccupied with maintaining ‘social order’, religion an important component of this. Glover was cleared of the charge, but the jury added a rider to its acquittal noting that the publication of such material should be discouraged.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In 1924, the publication’s name was changed to the New Zealand Worker. The paper’s sub-title also changed. It went from ‘A journal of industrial unionism, socialism and politics’ to ‘A New Zealand paper for New Zealand people’. Although trade unions still funded its publication, control now rested with the Labour Party.  The radicalism softened rapidly and substantially as the Labour Party sought electoral respectability. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; E whakaarotia whānuitia ana he putanga hiranga nui te Maoriland Worker ki te kaupapa reipa o Aotearoa. I te tīmatatanga o te rautau rua tekau e rua ngā peka o te kaupapa reipa – ko te hunga e whai ana i te pāhoro, me te hunga e whai ana kia whakahoutia ngā tikanga, i whakaritea hoki e ia rōpū he putanga hei whakaata, hei whakaputa hoki i ō rātou tirohanga ki te ao. Kāore i uru pai ngā kaiuniana kaitaua ki raro i ia o aua karangatanga. Nā te kaha pēhi, whakahē hoki o ngā niupepa i a rātou i muri i tētahi tautohe utu i te tau 1910, i whakatauhia e te Shearers' Union i Ōtautahi kia tīmata i tā rātou ake pepa, Te Maoriland Worker hei putanga ā-marama. I whakaputaina te niupepa i Ōtautahi mō te wā poto, i reira i tino kitea ngā mahi a Ettie Rout me Alexander Wildey.  I te whakakotahitanga o te uniana kaikutikuti hipi ki te uniana kaimaina, kua noho te pepa hei kanohi mō te Federation of Labour 'Whero', ā, i te tīmatatanga o 1911, i nekehia tana tari whakaputa ki Te Whanga nui ā-Tara. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; I raro i te ētitatanga o Bob Ross nō Ahitereiria, he tere te tipu o te niupepa, he mea whakaputa ā-wiki ināianei, i runga i te nui o ngā kaipānui, i runga hoki i te kaha o tōna awe. I te tau 1912, 8,500 ngā kaipānui, ā, 10,000 i te tīmatatanga o te tau whai muri mai. Me kī ko te pokapū tērā o te Federation mō te akiaki i te mana hapori. E rikarika ana ngā kaiuniana kia tū hei 'paper boy', he whatunga kairīpoata tūao hoki tō rātou puta noa i ngā motu. I te tino taunaki te kaupapahere ētita a te Maoriland Worker i te unianatanga ahumahi, te mahitahitanga a ngā kaiuniana puta noa i te ao, me te whakamārietanga.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I eke ngā tikanga tārei i te Maoriland Worker i runga i tētahi paerewa ngaio teitei tonu, tae atu ki ētahi o ngā pakiwaituhi tōrangapū tīwharawhara hoki o te wā.  I wehe atu a Ross i te tau 1913, nō muri mai i whiwhi i tana whakakapi a Harry Holand te tūranga o te kaitātaki o te Labour Party. I hāmenetia a Holland mō te mahi whana kāwanatanga mō tana rīpoata i tētahi tautohenga wāpu i huri hei taraiki whānui i te mutunga o te tau 1913. I whiua a ia ki te kotahi tau i roto whareherehere, engari i mauheretia mō te toru marama noa iho. Nō muri tata i pakaru mai te pakanga, ko te tū a te Maoriland Worker ko te tū a te kaikōkiri mana hapori ā-ao, i puta hoki ngā matapae a Holland i ngā kōrero ētita mō te ekenga o te pāhoro ā-ao. I wehe a ia i te pepa i te tau 1918 i tana pōtitanga ki te Whare Pāremata i tētahi pōtitanga-iti. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; He kaha tonu te whakaputa a ngā tirohanga wāwāhi tikanga puta noa i ngā tau o te pakanga tae atu ki ngā tau tuatahi o ngā 1920. I waenga i ngā tau o te pakanga i pēhingia hoki te niupepa e ngā utu kupu whakakino, te aukatinga me te inonotitanga pirihimana. I te tau 1921 i tāngia e te Maoriland Worker ētahi ruri nā te kaitito rongonui Peretania o te pakanga a Siegfried Sassoon.  I kitea e ngā mana o te wā ngā raina e toru o 'Stand to: Good Friday Morning’ i hāmenetia te kaiwhakaputa o te pepa mō te 'kupu whakakino kohukohu'. I whakawāhia a John Glover i te Supreme Court i te tau 1922, koira anake te momo kēhi pērā i te hītori ture o Aotearoa. I tū te whakawā i tētahi wā ko te pēhi i te hunga whakararu i ngā wā me ngā wāhi ka taea te mahi, ā, i te aro kē ngā kaitōrangapū ki te pupuritanga o te 'raupapa pāpori', ko te hāhi tētahi wae tino nui o tēnei momo mahi. I wetea a Glover i te whakapae, engari i tāpirihia atu e te tekau mā rua he kōrero ki tana wetenga e kī ana e tika ana kia whakapāhunu i aua momo tuhinga. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1924, i hurihia te ingoa o te putanga ki te New Zealand Worker. I huri hoki te taitara-roto. I huri mai i te kōrero 'He hautaka o te unianatanga ahumahi, te mana hapori me te tōrangapū' ki 'He pepa nō Aotearoa mā ngā tāngata o Aotearoa'. Ahakoa i te whai pūtea tonu te putanga i ngā uniana, i te noho tonu te mana whakahaere i te Rōpū Reipa.  He tere, he nui hoki te heke o te mahi wāwāhi tikanga i a te Labour Party e whai ana kia tika tō rātou āhua ā-tōrangapū.  &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Mataura Ensign began publication in Gore (in Southland) on 10 May 1878 by Joseph Mackay who owned the Bruce Herald in Milton at the time. He ensured that his new venture began soundly by first securing backing from several of the Mataura Valley's prominent businessmen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The paper's name was suggested by Mackay's business partner George Renner, after the Scottish newspaper the Northern Ensign. Renner and his partner James Sinclair canvassed the district for subscribers and advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Milton newspaper publisher Alfred Dolamore bought the Ensign in August 1882. Mackay went on to establish the Southern Free Press at Mataura but this paper failed to compete with the Mataura Ensign, as did its later rival, the Gore Standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dolamore had previous experience on the Nelson Evening Mail and Southland Times. The Mataura Ensign expanded rapidly under Dolamore and he took on additional partners including his brother Howard. The paper moved into larger premises and increased the circulation area. Dolamore died in 1895 and after a disastrous fire which destroyed everything except the printing machine, the paper moved to new premises in Mersey Street, Gore. The Ensign became a daily in April 1906.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the Dolamore's stewardship the paper retained a strong literary flavour, claiming amongst its staff the noted historian James Herries Beattie (1881-1972). He compiled extensive files on the history of Southland through oral interviews and correspondence. William Gilchrist, headmaster of East Gore School from 1891, wrote as "Uncle Phil" for many years, encouraging children to write well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1920 the Gore Publishing Company was formed and included a number of the paper's employee. The newspaper changed its name to the Ensign in 1973 and is still published daily.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ka tīmata te puta mai o te Mataura Ensign, mai i te tāone o Gore i Murihiku i te 10 o Haratua i te tau 1878. Ko te tangata nana i tārai ko Joseph Mackay. Nōna anō hoki te nūpepa o Milton e kīia nei ko te Bruce Herald. I āhei ake ia kia tino kaha taua nūpepa, ā, i tēnei nā ka haere ia kia tautokona taua nūpepa e ngā tangata kaipakihi rongonui o te riu o Mataura.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nā tētahi o ngā hoa kaipakihi o Mackay, arā, ko George Renner, i whakaaro kia tāpaia te ingoa o te nūpepa o Kotarangi (Scotland), arā, te Northern Ensign, hei ingoa mō te nūpepa nei. Ko te mahi a Renner rāua ko tana hoa kaipakihi a James Sinclair, hei whai ake i ngā kaitango koha, i ngā kaipānui hoko rānei mō te nūpepa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I te marama o Here-turi-kōkā 1882, ka hokona e Alfred Dolamore te Ensign. Ko ia hoki te kaiwhakaputa nūpepa i te tāone o Milton. I ngā tau ki muri i tīmataia e Joseph Mackay te Southern Free Press ki Mataura, ēngari kāore i ora tēnei nūpepa i te taha o te Mataura Ensign, ā, i pērā anō tērā o ngā nūpepa whakataetae, a te Gore Standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mua hoki, i mahi ia i ngā nūpepa e kīia nei ko te Nelson Evening Mail me te Southland Times. Ka tino tere te piki o te kaha o te Mataura Ensign, ā, ka whakaurua e ia he hoa kaipakihi anō, ā, ko tētahi ko tana tungāne a Howard. Ka nuku taua nūpepa ki roto kē i tētahi tari nui kē, ā, ka rahi kē atu anō te rohe e kapi ai. I te tau 1895 ka mate a Dolamore, ā, i muri atu i tētahi ahi nunui nei ka ngaro katoa te tari, ā, ko te mīhini tā nūpepa anake i toe. Ka nuku te nūpepa ki tētahi whare hou i te tiriti o Mersey, i te tāone o Gore. Nō te marama o Paenga-whāwhā i te tau 1906, ka puta mai ia rā taua nūpepa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I raro i te kaiārahitanga o Dolamore, ka mau tonu te kaupapa whakaputa tuhituhinga mātauranga. I taua wā anō ko tētahi o ngā kaimahi o taua nūpepa nā, ko tētahi tonu o ngā toa mō te tuhituhi kōrero o nehe. Ko James Herries Beattie (1881-1972) tana ingoa. I hangaia e ia ētahi tukunga kōrero e pā ana ki te tāhuhu korero o Murihiku. I hopukina e ia aua kōrero mai i te kōrero ā-kanohi me te tuhi anō hoki ki ētahi atu tāngata. Ko te kaituhi "Uncle Phil" ko William Gilchrist, te tumuaki o te kura o Gore ki te rāwhiti. I tuhi ia mai i te tau 1891, ā, mō ngā tau nui ki muri hoki. Ko tana mahi hei whakakaha i ngā taitamariki kia tino pai ake tā rātau tuhi.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Marlborough Express is the daily newspaper of Blenheim and has been 
        published there since 1866.&lt;/p&gt;        
      &lt;p&gt;In 1866 the prospects for a new newspaper in Marlborough were not good. 
        The population of the province was small and Marlborough already had two 
        newspapers. A third, the Marlborough Times, had folded the year before 
        after a few months in operation.&lt;/p&gt;        
      &lt;p&gt;The Express was founded by Samuel Johnson. Johnson already had some experience 
        as a journalist in England and New Zealand. He had arrived in 1862 with 
        the Albertians, a band of idealistic settlers who settled in North Auckland. 
        Johnson edited the Albertian newspaper the Albertland Gazette for a short 
        time until he became disillusioned with the settlement. He then worked 
        on newspapers in other parts of the country before settling on Blenheim.&lt;/p&gt;        
      &lt;p&gt;Politics in Marlborough was dominated by rivalry between Blenheim and 
        Picton, and this was reflected in the Marlborough newspapers. Originally 
        the Press was published in Blenheim but had moved to Picton. The publishers 
        tried to placate Blenheim residents by saying that the paper was actually 
        published in both places, but eventually they had to publish a separate 
        Blenheim paper, the Wairau Record. When launching the Express Johnson 
        promised to give Marlborough a paper that would serve the whole province. 
        Perhaps it was this attempt to rise above the squabbling between Blenheim 
        and Picton that helped the Express establish itself and ultimately prevail 
        over its rivals. &lt;/p&gt;        
      &lt;p&gt;In 1879 Johnson sold the Express to Smith Furness and James Boudy. Furness 
        had worked on newspapers in Wellington, Nelson, and Ashburton. The Furness 
        family controlled the Express until 1998 when it was sold to Independent 
        Newspapers Limited (INL). The Express became a daily in 1880 and took 
        over its rivals the Marlborough Times in 1895 and the Marlborough Press 
        in 1948.&lt;/p&gt;

Kua hinga kē hoki te tuatoru, arā, te Marlborough Times, i te tau o mua, i muri mai i ētahi marama noa e whakahaeretia ana. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nā Samuel Johnson te Express i whakaū. Kua whai mātanga kē a Johnson hei kaituhi nūpepa i Ingarangi, i Aotearoa hoki. I tae mai ia i te tau 1862 i te taha o ngā Albertians, tētahi rōpū tāngata whai, whai whakaaro rangatira tonu, i noho ki te Tai Tokerau. Nā Johnson i whakatika te nūpepa o te rōpū Albertian, arā, te Albertland Gazette, mō tētahi wā poto, puta rawa tōna matekiritanga i tērā nohanga. Ka mahi tonu ia i ētahi nūpepa i wāhi kē o te whenua i mua i tana nohonga ki Waiharakeke. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I te tau 1879 ka hokona te Express e Johnson ki a Smith Furness rāua ko James Boudy. Kua mahi hoki a Furness i ētahi nūpepa i Pōneke, i Whakatū (Nelson) me Hakatere (Ashburton). Nā te whānau Furness te Express i whakahaere tae ana ki 1998, i tōna hokonga ki te kamupene Independent Newspapers Limited (INL).

    <Essay language="en">
    &lt;p&gt;Newspaper publishing began in the Foxton area in the 1870s when the Manawatu was 
      opened up for European settlement. In this period Foxton’s port was 
      developed and the town was linked by coach and rail to the main 
      centres in the lower North Island.&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;The Manawatu Herald was founded by brothers George Warren Russell and John 
      Ruffell Russell in 1878. It was the first paper published in Foxton, 
      following unsuccessful attempts in 1873 to publish a newspaper called the 
      Manawatu Guardian. George Russell had worked on newspapers in Invercargill 
      and Wellington and went on to work on others, in particular the Spectator 
      in Christchurch. He was also a prominent Member of the House of 
      Representatives and cabinet minister during the First World War. &lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;George Russell did not stay with the Herald for long. By 1882 he had moved on to 
      the Manawatu Times in Palmerston North leaving his brother with the Foxton 
      paper. The Herald was sold to Ernest Thynne in 1889. During Thynne’s 
      tenure the Herald had a rival paper to contend with, the Foxton Telegraph, 
      which ran for four years from 1896. The local council appear to have 
      encouraged the Telegraph by dividing council advertising between it and the Herald. This was probably 
      because Thynne and the Herald represented the rural lobby in Foxton.&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;In 1906 Thynne sold the paper to John Knowles Hornblow. Hornblow came from a 
      family of newspapermen; his father wrote for the New Zealand Times, and 
      Hornblow and his brothers worked on various Wairarapa newspapers. Hornblow 
      owned the Wairarapa Standard in Greytown before taking over the Herald.&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;When Hornblow took over the Herald, Foxton was a town with prospects. There 
      were plans to extend the port and it was hoped that the main trunk line 
      would go through Foxton. Unfortunately within a year or two these 
      prospects were gone. The port development did not go ahead and the railway 
      that was completed in 1908 bypassed Foxton. Despite this Hornblow and his 
      son Robert managed to keep the Herald running, with Robert taking over as 
      proprietor after his father died in 1937. The paper changed hands several 
      more times before ceasing publication in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;The Herald was initially published twice a week then moved to thrice weekly in 
      1890, back to bi-weekly in 1944 and then weekly from 1956. In 1955 the 
      title was changed to the Foxton Herald and in 1961 it reverted to the 
      Manawatu Herald.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I tīmatahia te tānga nūpepa i te takiwā o Foxton i te tekau tau mai i 1870 i te whakapūaretanga o Manawatu hei nohanga Pākehā. I whakawhanaketia te poi o Foxton i tēnei wā, ā, nā te kōti, nā te tereina hoki i hono ai te tāone ki ngā tāone mātua o te Ūpoko o te Ika a Māui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nā te tuakana a George Warren Russell rāua ko te teina a John Ruffell Russell te Manawatu Herald i whakaū i 1878.  Koia te nūpepa tuatahi i tāngia ki Foxton, i muri i ngā whakamātauranga huakore ki te whakaputa i tētahi nūpepa i huaina te Manawatu Guardian i te tau 1873. Kua mahi kē a George Russell i ētahi nūpepa i Waihopai (Invercargill) me Pōneke, ā, i haere tonu ki ētahi atu mahi ai pērā i te Spectator i Otautahi. He mema whakarae anō ia o te Whare Pāremata, he minita hoki o te Rūnanga o te Kāwanatanga i te wā o te Pakanga Tuatahi o te Ao&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kāhore tonu i roa te noho a George Russell ki te Herald. Tae ana ki te tau 1882 kua neke kē ia ki te Manawatu Times i Te Papaioea (Palmerston North), mahue ana tana teina i te nūpepa i Foxton. I hokona te Herald ki a Ernest Thynne i te tau 1889. I a Thynne te pupuritanga, he tāwhai tautohenga tō te Herald, arā, te Foxton Telegraph, he nūpepa i haere tonu e whā ngā tau mai 1896. Te āhua nei nā te kaunihera ā-rohe te Telegraph i āki, i tā rātou wāwāhitanga i ngā pānui kaunihera i waenganui i te Telegraph me te Herald. I heipū pea tēnei āhuatanga i te mea hei kanohi a Thynne me te Herald mō te rōpū pōti taiwhenua o Foxton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I te tau 1906 ka hokona te nūpepa e Thynne ki a John Knowles Hornblow. Nō tētahi whānau kaituhi nūpepa a Hornblow.

    &lt;p&gt; Keen to have his own newspaper, Alexander McMinn, editor of the Rangitkei Advocate, established the Manawatu Standard in 1880 as a four page morning daily, the first daily in Palmerston North. The first issue, dated 29 November 1880, contained an editorial written by John Ballance.   &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; As circulation increased (estimated at 1,500 in 1881), technology improved, with replacement of the hand-press by a steam-driven printing press, and town and country editions were introduced. Relations with the rival Manawatu Times were disputatious.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Brothers Frederick and David Pirani took it over in 1891 and later changed it to an evening publication. Martha Pirani, wife of Frederick, wrote editorials for the paper. Liberal Independent in politics, it circulated in the Manawatu District, Hawke’s Bay and Taranaki and was recognised for its stock sale advertisements. Frederick won the seat of Palmerston in the election of 1893 and remained in office until his retirement due to poor health in 1902. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Manawatu Standard was sold to John Coombe and Norman Henry Nash in 1903. The Standard celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 1930, with a special issue. Despite further changes in ownership, it continued to be published into the 21st century. &lt;/p&gt;

    <Essay language="en">
    &lt;p&gt; The Mt Benger Mail was one of a number of newspapers, mostly short-lived, which appeared in Central Otago during the gold rush era in the nineteenth century. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; John Weatherall began the Mt Benger Mail at Roxburgh in 1880. A brief item in the Bruce Herald of 30 April that year announced that the Mt Benger Mail was about to be published ‘at the low price of 3s per quarter’. It also mentioned that John Weatherall was ‘for several years in the Tuapeka Times office’. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Gaining a reputation as a ‘rag-planter’ in the region, Weatherall had other forays into newspaper ownership – the Central Otago Leader for one – but was proprietor of the weekly Mt Benger Mail until 1896.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Apparently, Weatherall did not initially own the paper’s press, as the Tuapeka Times reported in November 1883 that John Thompson, auctioneer and Times shareholder, had sold him the plant of the Tuapeka Press  (closed in 1869)  and Mt Benger Mail for £47 10s (about $8,000 today). The same year Weatherall and journalist James Rowe re-launched the Tuapeka Press as a bi-weekly.  It was short-lived, possibly coinciding with Weatherall and Rowe filing for bankruptcy – this remaining in force for about a year. After selling the Mt Benger Mail in 1896, Weatherall began the Tuapeka Recorder (the second paper of that name) in Lawrence and it appears to have survived four years. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; After he sold the Mt Benger Mail to P J Dunne and William P Matthews, it was reported in the Otago Witness that the new owners had secured new plant, and proposed to remodel the paper. The paper noted: ‘Mr Dunne was for some time on the literary staff of the Waimea Plains Review, and also of the Tuapeka Times, and is regarded as a clever and capable journalist.’ In about 1900 he joined the West Coast Times as editor. He left in 1909, and, moving to the North Island, he subsequently edited the Levin Chronicle and Ohakune Times before dying, aged 55, in 1920. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; William Matthews, who worked on the Otago Daily Times and Australian publications as well as the Tuapeka Times, was proprietor of the Mt Benger Mail when he died in January 1904 and the newspaper was purchased by Mr W Jack of Dunedin. At this time, the weekly, published on Fridays and considered ‘Independent Liberal’ in its politics, contained six, seven-column pages and was circulated widely in Central Otago. The newspaper’s premises contained, as the Cyclopedia of New Zealand reported in 1906: ‘an Albion press, Platen jobbing machine, and a good font of newspaper and jobbing type’.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In 1911 the newspaper was bought by the Tuapeka Times Co and printing shifted to Lawrence. After World War One, in 1919, W A Laloli bought the paper and it was again published in Roxburgh.  It became a daily in 1920 for a period. It survived, with reduced frequency, until the early 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;

I taua tau anō nā Weatherall rāua ko te kawe kōrero nei nā James Rowe i whakarewa anō te Tuapeka Press hei nūpepa e rua putanga i te wiki.  He poto noa te oranga, i te wā tonu tēnei o te tuku o Weatherall rāua ko Rowe ki te kōti pēkerapu –ka whai mana tēnei mō te takiwā o te tau kotahi. I muri i te hoko i te Mt Benger Mail i te tau 1896, nā Weatherall i tīmata te Tuapeka Recorder (te nūpepa tuarua he pērā te ingoa i Lawrence ā, ka ora pea mō te whā tau. &lt;/p&gt;

I kī te nūpepa: ‘I mahi a Dunne hei mema o ngā kaituhi o te Waimea Plains Review, me te Tuapeka Times, e whakaarotia ana he kaituhi mātau, pakari hoki.' I te takiwā o te tau 1900 ka tūhono ia ki te West Coast Times hei etita. I wehe atu ia i te tau 1909, ā, i tana nekehanga ki te Ika ā-Māui, ka etitatia e ia te Levin Chronicle me te Ohakune Times i mua i tōna matenga, e 55 te pakeke, i te tau 1920. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ko William Matthews, tētahi kaimahi i te Otago Daily Times me ētahi nūpepa i Ahitereiria, tae atu ki te Tuapeka Times, te kaihautū o te Mt Benger Mail i tōna matenga i te marama o Hānuere 1904 ā, hokona te nūpepa e W Jack o Ōtepoti.

    &lt;p&gt; The Mount Ida Chronicle and St Bathans Weekly News was one of the earliest goldfields newspapers to survive for a lengthy period. In May 1863, gold was discovered in the Hogburn Valley, on the Upper Taieri Plain 90 miles north-west of Dunedin, by a party of miners including the Parker brothers. The resulting township had various names – including Parker’s, Hogburn and Mount Ida – before settling on Naseby. The Mount Ida Chronicle was founded there in 1869 by Hugh Wilson who ran the paper with a succession of partners until his retirement in 1919. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The first partner was Henry Hertslet, a considerable landowner, whose involvement lasted only a year. Two years later Cecil de Lautour joined the paper as partner and editor, combining his editorial role with an increasing involvement in politics. In 1874, de Lautour was elected as one of the two members to represent the Mount Ida district on the Otago Provincial Council, remaining on it until its abolition in 1876. The same year he was returned as the member for Mt Ida in the House of Representatives, and won two subsequent elections in 1879 and 1881.  Cecil de Lautour’s actual involvement with the newspaper ended when he left the district in 1879 and moved to Poverty Bay. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Wilson’s next partner, from 1883, was Mackay J S (Scobie) Mackenzie. A successful runholder, he was also an aspiring politician. After some years on the Maniototo County Council, Mackenzie stood against de Lautour at the 1881 election, challenging the incumbent’s right to represent Mt Ida when he lived hundreds of kilometres away in the North Island. As the Otago Witness reported in Mackenzie’s September 1901 obituary: 
‘The contest which ensued had a sensational termination. Telegraphs were rarer in those days, and on the evening of the election it was concluded, in the absence of one or two outlying returns, that Mr Mackenzie was the member for Mount Ida. He was carried in triumph through the streets of Naseby, while his opponent left the town and travelled through the night to catch train and steamer for the north. Before daylight, however, a block vote for Mr de Lautour came in from the largest of the outlying places, and by a few votes the position was reversed.’ &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Scobie Mackenzie was elected to the House of Representatives in 1884, while de Lautour contested an Auckland seat unsuccessfully. Mackenzie was an accomplished journalist, writing regularly for the Mount Ida Chronicle and Australian newspapers. He served three terms as MP for Mount Ida and then held, from 1896-1899, a Dunedin seat. In 1896 his shares in the newspaper were sold to a relation-by-marriage, Alfred Dillon Bell, brother of Sir Francis Bell. John Reed took up the Bell interest in 1907 and ran the business following Wilson’s 1919 retirement until the newspaper’s 1926 sale and subsequent demise. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;  For much of its 57 years, the Mount Ida Chronicle was a weekly. Gold in the area was mined by hydraulic sluicing and the government built several miles of water races in 1875. Following this boost to the local mining industry, the newspaper appeared twice-weekly until 1899. Naseby was the commercial and local government centre of the Maniototo for the last 25 years of the 19th century and by 1880 one of the largest towns in the district, and claiming a population of about 4,000. As well as many hotels,  it had the county council chambers, town hall, courthouse, warden’s office, district hospital, several churches and schools, Masonic hall, Athenaeum (library and reading room), and racecourse. However, by the early 1920s, gold mining was finished and, with the Central Otago railway bypassing the town, Ranfurly became the new district centre. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;  The Mount Ida Chronicle provided informed and contrasting political comment during the period Cecil de Lautour and Scobie Mackenzie were writing for it. Before the parliamentary party era, both were independents, but de Lautour was of a liberal and Mackenzie a more conservative persuasion. The paper also provided a detailed coverage of an important period in the country’s gold mining history and was a conscientious recorder of the social life of the Maniototo. &lt;/p&gt;

He maha ngā ingoa rerekē o te tāone i tupu ake i reira  – inā rā ko Parker’s, ko Hogburn me Mount Ida – ā, tatū rawa atu ki te ingoa o Naseby. I whakatūria te Mount Ida Chronicle i reira i 1869 e Hugh Wilson nāna i whakahaere te nūpepa me te tini o ngā hoa mahi taea noatia tōna hekenga i tōna tūnga i te tau 1919. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ko te hoa tuatahi ko Henry Hertslet, tētahi kaipupuri whenua nui, i noho ki reira mō te tau kotahi noa iho. E rua tau i muri mai ka tūhono mai a Cecil de Lautour hei hoa, hei kaiwhakatika, arā, ka tuia tahitia āna mahi whakatika ki āna kuhunga ki te ao tōrangapū i aua wā. I te tau 1874, ka pōtitia ko de Lautour hei mema i te taha o te mema tuarua i pōtitia mō te rohe o Mount Ida i te Kaunihera ā-Rohe o Ōtākou, ā, ka noho i reira tae noa ki tōna whakakorenga i 1876. I taua tau anō ka whakahokia ia hei mema mō te Whare Pāremata, ā, ka wikitōria i ngā pōtitanga e rua whai i muri i ngā tau 1879 me 1881. I mutu katoa te mahi a Cecil de Lautour i te nūpepa i tana wehenga atu i te rohe i 1879 me tana nukuhanga atu ki Tūranga-nui-a-Kiwa.        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ko te hoa hou o Wilson mai i 1883, ko Mackay J S (Scobie) Mackenzie. He kaiahuwhenua whai take, ā, he tangata hoki ia i wawata kia uru ki ngā mahi tōrangapū. I muri i ētahi tau i te Kaunihera ā-Rohe o Maniototo, ka tauwhāinga atu a Mackenzie ki a de Lautour i te pōtitanga o 1881 me tana wero ki te tika o te tangata i te tūnga hei kanohi mō Mt Ida, inā hoki, i te noho kē a de Lautour i te Ika-a-Māui e hia kiromita kē ki te tokerau. Tērā ngā pūrongo a te Otago Witness i roto i te poroporoaki ki a Mackenzie i te Hepetema 1901: 
‘He whakamīharo te whakataetae i whai i muri. Kāore i tino nui ngā tarikarāwhe i aua tau, ā, i te pō o te rā pōtitanga i maharatia, ahakoa kāore anō kia tae mai ētahi o ngā huinga pōti o te tuawhenua, kua wikitōria a  Mackenzie ā, koia te mema hou mō Mount Ida. Ka kawea haeretia ia i runga i te rekareka o ngā hoa, mā roto i ngā tiriti o Naseby, ā, ka wehe atu tana hoa tauwhāinga i te tāone, ka haere i te roanga o te pō kia āhei tana piki ki runga tereina, me te tima hoki, kia tae atu ia ki te Ika-a-Māui. Engari i mua i te awatea o muri mai, ka tae mai tētahi huinga pōti nui mō de Lautour mai i ētahi atu o ngā wāhi tino nui o te tuawhenua, me te aha, kua takahuri anō te kaute, kia eke ko de Lautour hei kanohi.’ &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I pōtitia a Scobie Mackenzie ki te Whare Pāremata i te tau 1884, ā, i whakataetae a de Lautour i tētahi tūru i Tāmaki-makau-rau, engari kāore i eke. He kaituhi ringa rehe a Mackenzie ā, he auau tonu tāna tuhi mō te Mount Ida Chronicle me ētahi nūpepa i Āhitereiria. E toru ana tūnga hei Mema Pāremata mō Mount Ida, ā, i puritia tētahi tūnga i Ōtepoti i  1896-1899. I te tau 1896 ka hokona ana hea i te nūpepa ki tētahi whanaunga pākūhā ki a Alfred Dillon Bell, hei teina tēnei ki a Sir Francis Bell. Nā John Reed i hāpai ngā hea o te whānau Bell i te tau 1907 me te whakahaere i te umanga i muri i te hekenga a Wilson i tana tūranga i te tau 1919 taea noatia te hokonga me te mutunga o te nūpepa i te tau 1926. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Mō te roanga atu o ōna tau 57 ka noho te Mount Ida Chronicle hei nūpepa ā-wiki. Ko te puhanga wai te tikanga keri kōura i taua rohe, ā, i hangā hoki e te kāwanatanga ētahi maero terenga wai i te tau 1875. I muri i tēnei whakapikinga i te ahumahi keri kōura ā-rohe, e rua rawa ngā putanga o te nūpepa i te wiki, tae noa mai ki 1899. Ko Naseby tonu te pūtahi o ngā mahi arumoni, kāwanatanga hoki o Maniototo i ngā tau whakamutunga 25 o te rau tau 19. Nō te taenga ki te tau 1880 ka eke hei tāone nui i waenga i ngā tāone o te rohe, ko tōna taupori  kua piki ki te 4,000. Kua tū ōna hōtēra maha, tōna hōro tāone hoki, ōna tari kaunihera ā-takiwā, he whare kōti, he tari wātene, he hōhipera ā-rohe, ētahi whare karakia, kura hoki, he hōro Masonic, tētahi Athenaeum (he whare pukapuka, me tōna rūma pānui pukapuka) me te papa reihi hōiho. Ahakoa tēnei, kia tae ki ngā tau tuatahi i muri mai i 1920, kua mutu te mahi keri kōura, kua taha te rerewē o Central Otago i te tāone, ā, ka noho ko Ranfurly te pūtahi hou o te rohe.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Nā te nūpepa nei nā te Mount Ida Chronicle i hora ētahi whakapuaki whai whakaaro, whakamere hoki i te wā o āna kaituhi, a Cecil de Lautour rāua ko Scobie Mackenzie. I mua atu tēnei i ngā tau o ngā rōpū tōrangapū, nā reira he tangata tū takitahi tēnei tokorua. Heoi anō, he whakaaro ngāwari a de Lautour ā, he āhua mārō kē atu te tū a Mackenzie. He rawe ngā kohinga kōrero mō ngā āhuatanga o aua tau nunui o te keringa kōura i Aotearoa, ā, he pukumahi hoki te nūpepa ki te āta tuhi haere i ngā mahi, i ngā kōrero, i ngā huihuinga a ngā iwi o te rohe o Maniatoto i ōna rā. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Northern Advocate was launched in 1875 by George Edwin Alderton under the title Whangarei Comet and Northern Advertiser. In 1877 the title changed to the Northern Advocate and General Advertiser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the title suggests, the Advocate was set up to voice the concerns of Northlanders. Its stated purpose was to redress "the real criminal injustice the northern settlements laboured under from the legislature of the colony".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Advocate quickly established itself. Initially it was issued weekly. It had 12 pages and carried a small section printed in Māori. It probably started daily publication in 1902 in response to the setting up of another newspaper in Whangarei, the Northern Chronicle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Advocate had various rivals over the years. In 1891 there was the Kamo and Hikurangi Gazette which probably only lasted a year. A potentially serious competitor emerged in 1902 - the Northern Chronicle. The publisher of this paper was Francis Mander. Mander, the father of the author Jane Mander, was a local MP and businessman. However before the Chronicle got established, Mander acquired the Advocate and closed the Chronicle. For a short time in the 1900s there were two daily newspapers in Whangarei besides the Advocate. These were the Whangarei County Press (1905-1908?) and the Northern Mail (1908-1914?). Whangarei could not support three newspapers and The Press closed down almost immediately. The Mail and the Advocate enjoyed a lively rivalry until 1914 when the owners of the Mail acquired the Advocate. The new owners formed the Northern Advocate Co. and closed the Mail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Advocate is still the daily newspaper in Whangarei.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;The Nelson Evening Mail was the first daily newspaper published 
         in Nelson. The first issue came out on 5 March 1866. Robert Lucas, 
         a printer who arrived in Nelson in 1859, started the paper. He had 
         previously published two other, short-lived papers - the Nelson 
         Advertiser (1860) and the Nelson Intelligence (1862).&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;At the time the Mail began publication there were already two 
         existing newspapers in Nelson - the Examiner (1842-1873) and the 
         Colonist (1857-1921). The Mail provided strong competition for 
         them. It first forced the papers to go daily and then eventually 
         observed their demise -  the Examiner in 1873 and the Colonist 
         in 1921.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Since then the Mail has been Nelson's only daily newspaper. The 
         Lucas family managed the paper until 1993 when it was sold to 
         INL and its name changed to the Nelson Mail.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle was the first newspaper published in the South Island. It was established by Charles Elliott (1811-1876) in 1842, within a few weeks of the New Zealand Company settlers arriving in Nelson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Examiner, like its contemporary in Wellington, the New Zealand Gazette, was founded with a loan from the New Zealand Company. And even though the loan was paid back within a few years and despite disavowals from Elliott, the paper was always regarded by many colonists as an organ of the Company. Certainly the Examiner expressed very similar views to the Company, particularly concerning representative government for the settlers and it was an unrelenting critic of the colonial administration in Auckland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Thomas Hocken, the Examiner was “esteemed the best of all early New Zealand newspapers, and had eminent colonists as its editors and contributors”. These contributors included prominent politicians such as Alfred Domett, Francis Dillon Bell, Edward Stafford and William Fox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elliott himself was politically active, holding various offices in the provincial government of Nelson in the 1850’s and 1860’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the Examiner was unable to compete with the two other Nelson papers, the Colonist and the Nelson Evening Mail. The Examiner was too closely aligned with the interests of the large run-holders in the Wairau, who included Charles Elliott and his brother James. The Colonist was established in 1857 to oppose these landed proprietors. The paper lost much of its support when the Wairau was incorporated into the neighbouring province of Marlborough in 1859.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Examiner tried to compete by moving to daily publication in 1873 and setting up subsidiary publications. These included the Illustrated Examiner (1869), the Weekly Examiner (1873), Wakamarina Intelligencer (1874). None of these publications could be sustained and the paper folded in 1874.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ko te Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle te nūpepa tuatahi i tāhia ki roto i Te Waipounamu. I whakatūhia e Charles Elliot (1811-1876) i te tau 1842, i roto i ngā wiki i muri tonu mai i te taenga mai o ngā tāngata whai ki Whakatū.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Pērā anō i tērā nūpepa o taua wā o Te Whanganui ā-Tara, te New Zealand Gazette, i tīmatahia mai i tētahi pūtea taurewa mai i te New Zealand Company. Ahakoa i ea te nama i roto i ngā tau tata me ngā whakahē a Galvin ki ō rātau whakaaro, e ai ki te nuinga o ngā tāngata taiwhenua he wāhanga kē te pepa nei nō te Kamupene. Ka mutu he tino ōrite ngā whakaaro o te Examiner ki ō te Kamupene, otirā mō te kāwanatanga ka noho hei māngai mō ngā tāngata whai, me tā rātau whakahē mutukore i ngā whakahaere taiwhenua i Tāmaki Makaurau.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;E ai ki a Thomas Hocken, ko te Examiner “te nūpepa pai rawa atu o ngā nūpepa i tā tuatahihia ki roto o Aotearoa, me ngā tāngata taiwhenua tohunga i noho hei kaietita, hei kaituhi hoki”. Ko ētahi o ngā kaituhi nei ko ngā kaitōrangapū rongonui ko Alfred Domett, Francis Dillon Bell, Edward Stafford me William Fox.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;He tangata tōrangapū hoki a Elliot, ā, nōhia e ia ngā momo tari i roto i te kāwanatanga ā-rohe o Whakatū i ngā tau 1850 me ngā tau 1860.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Heoi anō, kāre i kaha te Examiner ki te whakataetae atu ki ērā nūpepa e rua o Whakatū, te Colonist me te Nelson Evening Mail. He tata rawa te hono o te Examiner ki ngā hiahia a ngā kaipupuri i ngā rohenga whenua o Wairau, pēnei i a Charles Elliott me tana teina a James. I whakatūhia te Colonist i te tau 1857 hei whakahē i ēnei rangatira pupuri whenua. I haumate haere te tautoko mai i te nūpepa i te whakatōpūtanga o Wairau ki roto i te rohe takiwā o Marlborough i te tau 1859.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;I whakahau te Examiner ki te whakataetae atu mā te tā putanga ia rangi i te tau 1873 me te tīmata i ētahi atu pānui i raro i tōna maru. Pēnei i te Illustrated Examiner (1869), me te Weekly Examiner (1873), Wakamarina Intellingencer (1874). Karekau tētahi o ēnei pānui i ora, whāia ka mutu te nūpepa nei i te tau 1874.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The North Otago Times was first published on 25 February 1864 under the 
        title Oamaru Times and Waitaki Reporter.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The paper was founded by Frank Pinkerton. In 1870 William Jukes Steward 
        was the registered owner and the title was changed to the North Otago 
        Times. Initially the paper had been issued weekly, but in 1876 it began daily 
        publication. This was in anticipation of the setting up of a rival daily, 
        the Oamaru Mail. The rivalry was real but sporting - the Times printed 
        the first issue of the Mail in 1876 when the Mail's equipment failed. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Mail was started by William Jukes Steward, the local MP, who had previously owned 
        the Times. Steward and some associates probably started 
        the paper to provide a forum for their political views particularly those 
        concerning the abolition of provincial government in New Zealand. Steward 
        was in favour of abolition even though the Otago MPs tended to favour 
        retention of the provincial system.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Initially the Mail struggled against the Times and the paper soon changed 
        hands. However the Mail was given an unexpected boost in 1877, as a result 
        of the new owner George Jones being tried by the House of Representatives 
        for criminal libel for comments printed in the Mail. This was the first 
        state trial ordered by Parliament. Jones was acquitted and gained a reputation 
        as a champion of freedom of the press. The public showed its appreciation 
        by patronising the Mail. Its circulation and advertising rose. The Mail 
        ultimately triumphed over the Times - it is still published whereas the 
        Times ceased in 1932.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Advertiser is a significant New Zealand newspaper. It was New 
      Zealand’s second earliest newspaper. It was a forerunner to the 
      Government Gazette as it was used by the colonial administration to 
      publish official notices. The Advertiser also was effectively suppressed 
      by the government for criticising its policy on land.&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;The Advertiser was published in Kororareka from June to December 1840 and ran 
      for twenty-seven issues. It was printed by G. A. Eager and edited by the 
      Rev. Barzillai Quaife.&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;The paper owed its existence to the government who used it as their gazette. 
      While this was its primary function the newspaper also represented settler 
      opinion, particularly concerning land claims. On this issue Quaife was 
      critical of the colonial administration. &lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;The government responded by invoking anti-press laws instituted in New South 
      Wales in 1827 (New Zealand, at this stage was subject to New South Wales 
      law). The cost of complying with these laws was more than the paper could 
      bear and it suspended publication in December 1840. It seems clear that 
      this is what the government intended. The anti-press laws had hardly been 
      enforced and compliance was required only after Quaife started criticising 
      the government.&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;On 30 December 1840 the Government began publishing its own gazette. In the 
      first issue it was claimed that the Advertiser was no longer being used 
      for government notices because the newspaper had declined to publish them. 
      This was greeted with disbelief by settlers, who found it hard to accept 
      that the newspaper would turn down the very business that sustained it. 
      The government copped much criticism for its actions from the New Zealand Gazette, 
      New Zealand’s other newspaper at the time.&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;History repeated itself in 1842 when Quaife went on to edit another newspaper, the 
      Bay of Islands Observer. He continued to criticise government policy on 
      land and the government responded by effectively putting him out of 
      business, although this time with threats of libel actions. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ko te New Zealand Advertiser tētahi nūpepa hira tonu o Aotearoa. Ko ia te tuarua o ngā nūpepa o Aotearoa.

He nui atu i tā te nūpepa i āhei ki te waha te utu tautuku ki ēnei ture, ā, ka whakatārewatia te tānga o te nūpepa i Hakihea 1840. Kei te āhua mārama tonu koia tonu te tūmanako o te kāwanatanga.

    <Essay language="en">
    &lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Colonist and Port Nicholson Advertiser illustrates the 
         factionalism and divergent interests of the early Wellington colonial community. 
         The newspaper was published to counter the New Zealand Company's New Zealand 
         Gazette.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;The Gazette had been established in August 1839 by Samuel Revans who was a staunch 
         friend and advocate of the Company. The Gazette's editorial policy was extremely 
         pro-Company. Revans believed that serving the interests of the Company would also 
         serve the interests of the settlement and the settlers. To this end he deliberately 
         censored anti-Company opinions. His championing of the Company became increasingly 
         unpopular as the settlers' and the Company's views and interests diverged.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;The Gazette's factional and increasingly anti-settler position eventually led 
         to a group of fifty local merchants and landowners establishing a rival paper, 
         the New Zealand Colonist. It started in August 1842 and was published bi-weekly.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;As the Colonist was intended to be opposition for the Gazette it took a strongly 
         anti-Gazette and pro-settler editorial position. However the Colonist struggled 
         financially from the beginning and its position was made more difficult by lack 
         of support from the Company, which was one of the main sources of revenue in 
         the fledgling colony.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;The Colonist stopped publication exactly a year after it began, mainly due to 
         poor sales combined with a ruinous fire in its Lambton Quay office. Patrick 
         Day (The Making of the New Zealand Press, 1990) says that "the failure of 
         the small settlement to support a second newspaper against the established 
         Gazette deprived Wellington of an able and largely disinterested voice."&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Revans soon fell out with the Company and, growing bored with the venture, 
         closed the New Zealand Gazette in September 1844.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;E whakaatu ana te New Zealand Colonist me te Port Nicholson Advertiser i ngā wehewehenga me ngā rerekētanga o te hapori koroni o Pōneke. I whakaputahia te nūpepa hei whakataetae i te New Zealand Gazette, te nūpepa a te Kamupene o Niu Tīreni (New Zealand Company).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tīmatahia te Gazette i Here-turi-kōkā o te tau 1839 e Samuel Revans, he tino hoa kaitautoko o te Kamupene o Niu Tīreni. He tino tautoko tā te kaupapa ētita ki taua Kamupene. I tino whakapono a Revans mā te whai atu i ngā hiahia a te Kamupene e whai atu ai hoki i ngā hiahia o te tāone hōu me Hōpara i ngā pānuitangata whai. Mai i tēnei ka aukatihia e ia ngā whakaaro whakahē ki te Kamupene. Nā tana tohe ki te whakahau tonu i te Kamupene i piki ai te whakahē mai i te wehenga o ngā whakaaro me ngā hiahia o Hōpara i ngā pānuitangata whai me ērā o te Kamupene.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nā te wehewehe me te pikinga ake o ngā whakahē ki Hōpara i ngā pānuitangata whai i huri ai tētahi rōpū kaihoko, kaipupuri whenua, rima tekau te tokomaha, ki te whakatū i tētahi nūpepa whakataetae, arā, ko te New Zealand Colonist. I tīmata i Here-turi-kōkā o te tau 1842, ā, i whakaputahia hoki i ngā rā e rua ia wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nā te mea i whakaritea te Colonist hei nūpepa mautohe ki te Gazette ka huri ki te whakahē i te Gazette me te tautoko i Hōpara i ngā pānuitangata whai. ēngari he uaua te tīmatanga o te wāhanga pūtea o te Colonist, ā, ka tino pakeke ake hoki tōna tūnga nā te mea kāore i tautokohia e te Kamupene. Ko te Kamupene tētahi tino pūtake o ngā pūtea ki roto i te tāone hōu nei.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mutu ake te whakaputa a te Colonist ki roto i te tau kotahi mai i te tīmatanga nā te koretake o te tauhoko me te toronga o tōna tari i Lambton Quay i te ahi. E kī ana te kaituhi a Patrick Day (The Making of the New Zealand Press, 1990) "nā te kore o te tāone e tautoko i tētahi nūpepa tuarua hei whakataetae atu ki te Gazette i aukatihia ai te tāone o Pōneke i tētahi reo whaikiko, māia hoki".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kīhai i roa ka wehe mai a Revans i te Kamupene, ā, nā tana hōhā ki tēnei pakihi i katia ai te New Zealand Gazette i Mahuru o te tau 1844.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Spectator was the first Wellington newspaper to last for any length of time. It began weekly publication in October 1844, several weeks after the demise of the New Zealand Gazette, Wellington’s and New Zealand’s first newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Spectator was set up by a committee of local settlers to fill the gap left by the Gazette and to provide an alternative to it. The Gazette, a New Zealand company newspaper under the editorship of Samuel Revans, had been so vociferous in its attacks on the colonial administration that many settlers wanted a newspaper that was more temperate. However the Spectator soon found itself embroiled in conflict, when the paper’s printers published an item from Revans that was clearly an attack on local lawyer Daniel Wakefield (younger brother of Edward Gibbon Wakefield). The publishers dismissed the printers who responded by setting up a rival newspaper, the Wellington Independent. The Spectator immediately tried to put the Independent out of business by taking back the printing plant that they were using. The Independent got its own equipment and was back in business four months later. The Spectator and the Independent warred continually for years, advocating for opposing parties in local, provincial and national politics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From 1845 to 1858 the Spectator was published in Manners Street at the printing works of Robert Stokes (c.1810-80). Stokes was a member of the committee that set up the Spectator. He had originally come to Wellington in 1840 as a New Zealand Company surveyor. He was involved for many years in provincial and national politics, including being a member of Legislative Council from 1862 to 1879.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stokes was the virtual owner of the paper from about 1850. Under his management the Spectator was the only paper, other than the New Zealander, that supported George Grey and the colonial administration. Many settlers saw Stoke’s support for Grey as grovelling, motivated by a desire to ingratiate himself with the Colonial Office. For this he was described as a "scribbly toady".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Spectator always struggled to keep afloat and in 1865 it allowed itself to be taken over by its rival the Independent.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ko te New Zealand Spectator te nūpepa tuatahi o Te Whanga-nui-a-Tara i āhua roa tōna oranga. I tīmata te tānga ā-wiki i a Whiringa-ā-nuku 1844, i ētahi wiki maha tonu i muri mai o te matenga o te New Zealand Gazette, tō Te Whanga-nui-a-Tara me tō Niu Tireni nūpepa tuatahi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I whakatūria te Spectator e tētahi komiti o te hunga whai whenua, hei whakakapi i te āputa i mahue i te Gazette, hei nūpepa rerekē hoki. Ko te Gazette ia, he nūpepa a te Kamupene o Niu Tireni i raro i te takatānga o Samuel Revans, kua tino keakea rawa āna huaki ki te kāwanatanga tuawhenua, ā, ko te mutunga iho, kua pīrangi kē te maha o te hunga whai whenua i tētahi nūpepa āhua ngāwari kē ake. Heoi, kāore i roa kua puta kē atu te Spectator ki te mura o te ahi, nā te pānuitanga a āna kaiwhakatā i tētahi tuhinga a Revans, he mea i kitea noatia he huaki ki te rōia wā kāinga, ki a Daniel Wakefield (te teina o Edward Gibbon Wakefield). Ka panaia ngā kaiwhakatā e ngā kaiwhakaputa, nā, ko te urupare a ēnei ko te whakatū i tētahi nūpepa tāwhai, te Wellington Independent. I whakamātau wawe tonu te Spectator ki te whakamate i te Independent mā te tangonga i ngā mīhini whakatā i te whakamahia e rātou. Ka hokona e te Independent āna ake mīhini, ā, i te mahi anō e whā marama i muri mai. Ka whawhai tonu te Spectator me te Independent mō ētahi tau maha, me te tautoko i ngā rōpū ātete mō ngā take tōrangapū ā-kāinga, ā-rohe, ā-motu hoki.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mai i te tau 1845 ki te tau 1858 i whakaputaina te Spectator i te Tiriti o Manners, i te umanga whakatā a Robert Stokes (1810 pea ki te 1880). Ko Stokes tētahi mema o te komiti nāna te Spectator i whakatū. I tae tuatahi mai ia ki Te Whanga-nui-a-Tara i te tau 1840 hei kairūri whenua mō te Kamupene o Niu Tireni. He maha ngā tau i whai wāhi ia ki ngā mahi tōrangapū ā-rohe, ā-motu hoki, tae noa ki tana tūnga hei mema o te Whare Pāremata mai i te tau 1862 ki te tau 1879.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko Stokes te rangatira matua o te nūpepa mai i te takiwā o te tau 1850. I raro i tāna whakahaere, ko te Spectator anake te nūpepa, hāunga te New Zealander, i tautoko i a George Grey rātou ko te kāwanatanga tuawhenua. I kitea te tautoko a Stokes e te maha noa o te hunga whai whenua hei koropiko whakapatipati, he mea whakaoho e tana tāwhai kia āta manakohia e te Tari Tuawhenua. Nā reira i whakaahuatia ia hei "kaieneene tuhituhi kōkau".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ngā wā katoa i ngana te Spectator kia rewa tonu ana mahi, nāwai, i te tau 1865 ka whakaae kia taumanutia e tōna hoa tāwhai, e te Independent.&lt;/p&gt;

It was first published in Wellington in 1900 by Geddis and Blomfield as a spin-off from their successful Auckland weekly, the NZ Observer and Free Lance. The publishers split the title, with the Auckland paper becoming the NZ Observer and the Wellington paper taking the name Free Lance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite its initial association with the Observer, the Free Lance soon developed as a separate publication with the Geddis family concentrating on the Free Lance and Blomfield the Observer. The editor James McRobert Geddis (1856-1935) later became sole proprietor and in 1920 the Geddis family formed a private company to run the paper. The Geddis family were involved with the management of the Free Lance until it was incorporated into the New Zealand Weekly News in 1960. Its demise left the Weekly News as the last pictorial weekly in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Free Lance was a typical weekly; conservative and mainstream with much coverage given to royalty, New Zealand scenery, high society and sport. It was noted for its political cartoons. It carried the work of some of the country’s top cartoonists including John Gilmour, Gordon Minhinnick, Tom Ellis (Tom Glover), E.F. Hiscocks and Stuart Peterson. The Free Lance was fortunate to begin publishing at the same time as there was a flowering of local cartooning talent. The Free Lance not only benefited from this but also played a significant role in fostering this talent and pictorial journalism in general.&lt;/p&gt;

Nō muri mai ka noho tonu nō tōna takatā, nō James McRobert Geddis (1856-1935) anake te nūpepa, ā, i te tau 1920 ka whakatūria e te whānau o ngā Geddis he kamupene tūmataiti hei whakahaere i te nūpepa. I whai wāhi tonu te whānau o ngā Geddis ki te whakahaerenga o te Free Lance tae noa ki tōna komokomonga ki te New Zealand Weekly News i te tau 1960. I tōna matenga ka noho ko te Weekly News anake te nūpepa ā-wiki whai whakaahua i Aotearoa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He tānga tikanga noa te nūpepa ā-wiki, te Free Lance; he haratau ana kōrero, he mea rīroa me te nui o āna kōrero e aro atu ana ki ngā ariki taipuru o Ingarangi, ki ngā tirohanga o Niu Tireni, ki te hunga rangatira o te pāpori, ki ngā hākinakina anō hoki. I mōhiotia whānuitia mō āna waituhi whakakata tōrangapū. Whakaatu hoki ai i ngā mahi a ētahi kaitito waituhi whakakata pai rawa o te whenua, tae atu ki a John Gilmour, ki a Gordon Minhinnick, ki a Tom Ellis (Tom Glover), ki a E.F. Hiscocks, me Stuart Peterson. I waimarie tonu te Free Lance ki te tīmata i tana mahi whakaputa i te wā tonu i puāwai mai ai te pūmanawa waituhi whakakata i te wā kāinga. Kīhai te Free Lance i whaihua noa iho i tēnei āhuatanga, engari i hiranga tonu ana mahi whakatairangi i ēnei pūmanawa me te whakatairangi kapikapi i te mahi whakaputa hautaka whai whakaahua.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Gazette was New Zealand’s first newspaper. The Gazette was first published in London under the auspices of the New Zealand Company on 21 August 1839. A revised edition was issued a fortnight later. The second issue was published on 18 April 1840 in Wellington, making it the first newspaper printed in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gazette changed title several times in 1840. In August it added the words 'and Britannia spectator'; Britannia was the proposed name for Wellington. In November it changed Britannia to Wellington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper was initially owned and edited by Samuel Revans but it was always perceived as the mouthpiece of the New Zealand Company. It supported the Company in its incessant conflict with the colonial administration in Auckland. The vigour with which the Gazette did battle with the enemies of the Company alienated many of the public and in 1842 led settlers in Wellington to start a rival newspaper, the New Zealand Colonist and Port Nicholson Advertiser.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gazette expired quietly in September 1844. The printers of the Gazette were employed by the New Zealand Spectator and Cook’s Strait Guardian which began a few weeks later. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; In 1863, William Chisholm Wilson, an Auckland printer and businessman, withdrew from his partnership in the influential New Zealander to start a rival daily, the New Zealand Herald. The new daily had a clear editorial policy – a more constructive relationship between the North and South Islands and a combative response to what it termed ‘the native rebellion’ – but Wilson’s main motivation was commercial, seeing a business opportunity as Auckland’s population grew rapidly. &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt; Although the New Zealander closed in 1866, the Daily Southern Cross provided competition for a number of years, and particularly when Julius Vogel acquired a majority shareholding in 1868.  In 1876, Alfred Horton, a journalist and printer by training, sold his interest in the Thames Advertiser and bought Vogel’s then-ailing Daily Southern Cross. Shortly afterwards William Wilson died and the next year Horton and Wilson’s two sons merged their interests - the stronger mastheads surviving. The New Zealand Herald absorbed the Daily Southern Cross and its Weekly News incorporated the Weekly Herald. &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt; By the late 1870s the Auckland newspaper scene was dominated by the New Zealand Herald, in the morning, and the Auckland Evening Star (later Auckland Star) at night. The New Zealand Herald was consistently conservative; the Evening Star supported the liberal political movement that was beginning to gain ground. &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt; Alfred Horton’s interest in fast-changing newspaper technology led to Wilson and Horton’s installation of the country’s first rotary press at the New Zealand Herald in 1883. This was followed by a web machine in 1887 and linotypes in 1898. It was also the first local newspaper, in 1909, to run classified advertisements, with products and services sorted in categories. &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt; Horton also played a part in the founding of the NZ Press Association in 1878, which began to share local news among newspaper members and to channel news received from overseas. A year later he assisted in resolving problems with a rival news agency that led to the two joining forces as the United Press Association. The name changed back again to New Zealand Press Association in 1942. &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt; For decades the New Zealand Herald changed little in its appearance and sober, right-of-centre editorial stance; this was epitomised for half a century by the generally conservative cartoons of Gordon Minhinnick. The sobriquet ‘Granny Herald’ was part affection, part frustration. &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt; The New Zealand Herald became a public company in 1925, but a majority shareholding was retained, along with all the directorships, by the Wilson and Horton families. In 1996 the Dublin-based Independent News &amp; Media Group bought the Horton family’s shareholding. The paper is now owned by Australian Provincial Newspapers (APN), a subsidiary of Independent News &amp; Media. &lt;p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; He kaitā pukapuka, he tangata kaipakihi a William Chisholm Wilson.

 &lt;p&gt; Ahakoa i kati te New Zealander i te tau 1866, ka noho ko te Daily Southern Cross hei hoa whakataetae mō ētahi tau, otirā i tino pērā i te hokonga a Julius Vogel i te nuinga o ngā hea i te tau 1868. Nō te tau 1876, ka hoko a Alfred Horton i ana pānga i te Thames Advertiser. He kaikawe kōrero, he kaitā pukapuka a Horton. I muri ka hokona e ia te Daily Southern Cross a Vogel, i te hē haere ngā pūtea o taua pepa i taua wā. Kāore i roa i muri mai ka mate a William Wilson, ā, nō te tau o muri mai ka haumi ngā tama e rua a Horton rāua ko Wilson i ā rāua pānga - ka puritia kia ora ko ngā upoko niupepa pakari anake. Ka horomia te Daily Southern Cross e te New Zealand Herald, ka horomia te Weekly Herald e te Weekly News. &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt; Nō te mutunga o ngā tau mai i 1870, ka noho ko te niupepa nui ko te New Zealand Herald, i ngā ata, ā, hei ngā ahiahi ko te Auckland Evening Star (nō muri ka kīa ko te Auckland Star). He reo pupuri tikanga i ngā wā katoa te New Zealand Herald, ā, nā te Evening Star i tautoko te kōkiri tōrangapū kia whakangāwaritia ngā take me ngā āhuatanga katoa. &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt; Nā runga i ngā āhuatanga hangarau huri hohoro a Alfred Horton, ka whakaurua te mīhini tā hurihuri tuatahi e Wilson rāua ko Horton i te New Zealand Herald i 1883. Nō muri mai ko te mihini tukutuku o 1887, me te mīhini tā rārangi i te tau 1898. I 1909 koia hoki te niupepa ā-rohe tuatahi kia whakaputa i ngā pānui hokohoko, i wehea ai ngā hua hoko me ngā ratonga, tēnā, tēnā, ki tōna karangatanga, ki tōna karangatanga. &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt; I whai wāhi anō hoki a Horton ki te whakatūranga o te NZ Press Association i te tau 1878, i tīmata ai te tiritiri i ngā rongo kōrero huri noa i ngā mema niupepa, me te whāngai mai i ngā pitopito kōrero mai i tāwāhi. I te tau i muri mai ka āwhina ia ki te whakatau i ngā raruraru ki tētahi tari tauwhāinga, i tūhono ai ngā mahi a ngā whakahaere e rua i raro i te United Press Association. Ka hoki anō te ingoa ki te New Zealand Press Association i te tau 1942. &lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt; Kāore i rerekē te āhuatanga o te New Zealand Herald i te takanga o te hia ngahuru tau, mau tonu tōna āhua whakakaumātua, ōna whakaaro tū-ki-matau. Ko te whakatinanatanga o tēnei ko ngā pakiwaituhi pupuri tikanga a Gordon Minhinnick. Ko te ingoa whakawai ko 'Kui Hērara', he mihi tētahi wāhi o taua ingoa, he hōhā tētahi. &lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In the 1880s and 1890s some New Zealand publishers thought that there was a market for popular periodicals with a strong local focus. A number of titles, including Zealandia (1889), Citizen (1895), Critic (1899), were published in various cities. None of them met with much success or lasted for any length of time. The most significant of these parochial periodicals was the New Zealand Illustrated Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Illustrated Magazine tried but failed to compete with similar periodicals from overseas such as the Strand and the Bulletin. It is interesting to speculate as to why the New Zealand public preferred the imported varieties to the local. Perhaps the reading public was not as nationalistic as publishers thought they were and found that English and Australian periodicals represented their views as well or better than the indigenous magazines. It is also likely that the New Zealand periodicals suffered from competition with local newspapers, particularly the illustrated weeklies such as the Free Lance and Weekly News. These weekly papers had similar content to periodicals like the Illustrated Magazine and were well established by the late nineteenth century and very popular with the public.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;John Williamson started the New Zealander as a weekly newspaper 
         in 1845 and it was the main competitor of the Southern Cross. These 
         were the only two newspapers that became established in Auckland for 
         any significant period of time before the 1860s.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;The New Zealander began during the depression following the war 
         against Hone Heke in Northland. The paper aimed to represent the 
         interests of the average settler and Māori. It was the view of 
         the New Zealander that the interests of the larger land claimant 
         groups were already receiving more than enough coverage in the 
         Auckland Times. Ironically the Times closed shortly after the 
         New Zealander began publishing in June 1845.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;The Southern Cross was temporarily suspended in 1845 leaving the 
         New Zealander to continue without competition until the Southern 
         Cross was revived in 1847. The New Zealander responded to this 
         by publishing bi-weekly. In 1848 Williamson took William Chisholm 
         Wilson into partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;The paper steadily increased its influence. By 1859 it was the 
         leading paper in New Zealand and in 1863 it became a daily. Also 
         in that year the partnership split over the war against the Māori. 
         Williamson was against it while Wilson was for it. Wilson left to 
         set up the New Zealand Herald and Williamson carried on as the 
         sole owner.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;The New Zealander incurred some criticism for its comments on the 
         war. In June 1864 fifty men from the HMS Esk threatened to pull 
         down the newspaper office after one of the paper's correspondents 
         suggested that Captain Hamilton's death at Gate Pa was due to his 
         men having deserted. Williamson refused to apologise but did offer 
         to print a rebuttal from the seamen in his paper.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;By this time the New Zealander had begun to lose influence and 
         support. The paper's pro-Māori policy was moderated but it was 
         too late. In 1865 it couldn't sustain daily publication and had

    &lt;p&gt;Nā John Williamson te New Zealander i tīmata hei nūpepa ā-wiki i te tau 1845, koia rā te nūpepa tino whakataetae i te Southern Cross. Ko ēnei noa iho ngā nūpepa i tū i ākarana mō tētahi wā i mua o te tau 1860.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tīmata te New Zealander i te wā o te toimahatanga nō muri mai o te pakanga ki a Hone Heke i te Taitokerau. Ko tā te nūpepa he whakaatu i ngā take o te tangata whai pānga iti me te Māori. Ki te New Zealander he kaha tonu te whakapāohotanga o ngā whai pānga a ngā rōpū rapu whenua nui atu e te Auckland Times. Inā te korokē, nō muri tata noa mai o te tīmatanga ki te whakaputa i te New Zealander i te marama o Pipiri 1845, ka katia ai te Times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ka whakatārewatia te Southern Cross i te tau 1845, tukua ana te New Zealander kia haere kore whakataetae tae noa ki te tau 1847, arā, te tau o te whakaaranga ake o te Southern Cross. E rua whakaputanga ki te wiki te whakautu a te New Zealander. I te tau 1848, ka tīkina e Williamson ko William Chisholm Wilson hei hoa kaipakihi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ka tupu haere te whaimana o te nūpepa. Tae rawa ana ki te tau 1859 koia te tino nūpepa o Aotearoa, ā, i te tau 1863 ka puta ia rā, ia rā. I taua tau anō ka raru te hoa pakihi i te pakanga ki te Māori. Kīhai a Williamson i tautoko, ēngari a Wilson. Ka wehe atu a Wilson ki te whakatū i te New Zealand Herald, ka noho tonu a Williamson anahe hei rangatira.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ka whakahēngia te New Zealander i āna whakapuakitanga mō te pakanga. I te marama o Pipiri i te tau 1864 ka whakawehia mai e rima tekau o ngā heremana mai i te HMS Esk ki te turaki i te tari o te nūpepa nō muri mai o te puakitanga e tētahi o ngā kairīpoata a te nūpepa nā te whakarerenga o āna hōia i mate ai a Kāpene Hamilton i Pukehinahina. Kīhai a Williamson i whakapāha, ēngari i tukua kia tāngia ki tana nūpepa ētahi kupu tātā mai i ngā heremana.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ki tēnei wā ka kore haere te tautoko mai me te whaimana o te New Zealander. Ka whakatūpatotia te tauawhi kaupapa Māori, ēngari taea te pēwhea. Tae noa ki te tau 1865 kāore i taea te whakaputa ia rā, ka hoki kē ki ngā putanga e rua ia wiki. I te marama o Haratua i te tau 1866 nō te kānga o te tari i te ahi, ka kore te nūpepa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He tauira pai te New Zealander me te Southern Cross o te ū a ngā nūpepa o te motu ki te tōrangapū i taua wā, ā, he pērā rā anō ki ētahi atu tāone o Aotearoa.

    &lt;p&gt;The NZ Tablet was a Catholic periodical that was published weekly in Dunedin
        from 1873 to1996. It was set up to represent the interests of Irish Catholics
        throughout the nation. The Tablet was, particularly in its first fifty
        years or so, one of the most significant religious and political journals
      published in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;The Tablet was founded by Patrick Moran, the first Catholic bishop of Dunedin.
        Moran was an articulate but vitriolic polemicist on behalf of Irish Catholics.
        His outspoken criticism of the government – over the secularisation of
        education, which he saw as part of an international conspiracy against
        the Church, and the failure to fund Catholic schools –attracted national
        attention but alienated many, including the majority of the press. The
        Tablet was established to provide him with an alternative means to express
        his views; Moran often edited the paper and was a regular contributor
        to it.&lt;/p&gt;		
      &lt;p&gt;Moran was a staunch supporter of Irish nationalism and he
        ensured that the Tablet gave this cause much coverage. In fact there
        are indications that he sometimes regarded Irish issues as more important
        than Catholic ones; in the 1880s he criticised the Vatican for not supporting
        Irish nationalism as strongly as he thought they should.&lt;/p&gt;		
      &lt;p&gt;While Moran had many commendable qualities, his views and
        the vehemence with which he expressed them were divisive and served to
        separate Catholics from the wider community.&lt;/p&gt;		
      &lt;p&gt;After Moran’s death in 1895, the Tablet pursued a more moderate
        line with Henry Cleary as the editor. Cleary, who was in charge from
        1898 to 1908, favoured a much more conciliatory approach and he distanced
        the magazine from the cause of Irish nationalism. In 1918, ten years
        after leaving the Tablet, Cleary founded the Month, a moderate Catholic
        journal, to oppose the Tablet, which under James Kelly had returned to
        the strident approach of Moran. &lt;/p&gt;		
      &lt;p&gt;Kelly became the editor of the Tablet in 1917. He was probably
        even more outspoken on Irish issues than Moran. Kelly was a supporter
        of Sinn Fein and used the Tablet to promote their cause. His support
        for Irish nationalism and the anti-English comments he made in the Tablet
        during the war offended many New Zealanders. These were a factor in the
        rise of the Howard Elliott and the Protestant Political Association,
        a sectarian organisation that enjoyed widespread support throughout NZ
        during the war and through the 1920s. Kelly’s style became more bitter
        and fractious as the years went by and he was forced to resign as editor
        in 1931.&lt;/p&gt;		
      &lt;p&gt;The Tablet continued to be a prominent and often outspoken
        advocate for Catholic and Irish issues after Kelly but it did this in
        less strident and provocative ways. The Tablet remained an influential
        periodical, particularly under the editorship of John Kennedy, editor
        from 1967 to 1989. He was well known as a political commentator and some
        believe his support for the Labour party in 1972, expressed through the
        Tablet, was important in their election as the government that year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Tablet wound up in April 1996.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;He hautaka Katorika te NZ Tablet i tāngia ia wiki i Ōtepoti, mai i te tau 1873 ki 1996. I whakatūria hei māngai mō ngā pānga o ngā Katorika o Airangi huri noa te motu. Ko te Tablet, motuhake i ōna tau tuatahi e rima tekau pea, tētahi o ngā hautaka karakia, hautaka tōrangapū hoki, tino hira tonu o Aotearoa. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nā Patrick Moran, pīhopa Katorika tuatahi o Ōtepoti, te Tablet i whakaū. He tangata wahapū ia ēngari he kaitautohe pūkawa hoki mō ngā Katorika o Airangi. Nā āna kaha whakahē ā-waha i te kāwanatanga – mō te meatanga a te kāwanatanga i te mātauranga hei mea nō te whai ao, ki tāna titiro he wāhi hoki tēnei o tētahi kara ki te Hāhi huri noa te ao, mō te hinganga hoki a te kāwanatanga hei utu i ngā kura Katorika – i hakahaka ai te whakaaro o te motu, ēngari nāna anō i whakawehe i te nuinga, uru ana hoki te nuinga o te hunga tā nūpepa. I whakaūtia ai te Tablet kia whiwhi ia i tētahi huarahi kē hei whakapuaki i ōna whakaaro; he nui ngā wā nā Moran te nūpepa i whakatikatika, ā, koia anō tētahi o ngā kaituhi auau ki reira.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He kaitautoko kaha a Moran o te wawao whenua o Airangi, ā, i āta tirohia e ia kia kapia nuitia ai e te Tablet tēnei take. He tika tonu te whakaatu mai, i whakaarohia e ia he mea hira rawa ngā take o Airangi i ō ngā Katorika; i te tekau tau mai i 1880, i whakahēngia e ia te Watikana (Vatican) nōtemea kīhai i kaha tō rātou tautoko i te wawao whenua o Airangi pērā ki tōna i whakaaro ai.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ahakoa he maha ngā pai o Moran hei whakamihi, he mea whakawehewehe ōna whakaaro me te kaha o tana whakapuaki i aua whakaaro, ā, koia anō te whakawehe atu i ngā Katorika i te hapori whānui. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nō muri mai i te matenga o Moran i te tau 1895, he āhua ngāwari te huarahi i whaia e te Tablet i a Henry Cleary te takatā. I pai kē a Cleary, nāna hoki i whakahaere mai i te tau 1898 ki 1908, kia āhua tāpore kē te haere, ā, meinga ana e ia kia tawhiti atu te hautaka i te take o te wawao whenua o Airangi. I te tau 1918, arā, tekau tau i muri o tana wehenga atu i te Tablet, i whakaūtia e Cleary te Month, he nūpepa Katorika āhua ngāwari, hei tautohenga ki te Tablet, tērā kua hoki i raro i a James Kelly ki te āhua whakahaere pākinakina o Moran. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I meinga ko Kelly te takatā mō te Tablet i te tau 1917. Tērā pea, he kaha kē ia i a Moran hei waha kōrero mō ngā take o Airangi. Hei kaitautoko a Kelly i a Sinn Fein, ā, i whakamahia e ia te Tablet hei whakatairanga i tō rātou take. Nā tana tautoko i te wawao whenua o Airangi me āna kōrero matakēkē i ngā Ingarihi i roto i te Tablet i waenganui i te Pakanga, nā konei i weriweri ai ētahi tāngata maha o Aotearoa. Ko ēnei hoki tētahi take mō te rewanga o Howard Elliot me te Rōpū Porotehana Tōrangapū, he whakahaerenga rōpū wehe i tautokona whānuitia huri noa Aotearoa i waenganui i ngā tau o te Pakanga me te tekau tau mai i 1920. Ka kaha pūkawa haere, ka kaha whakawehewehe hoki te āhua o Kelly i te haerenga o ngā tau, nā wai ka ākina ia kia tukua te tūru takatā i te tau 1931. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haere tonu te Tablet hei māngai matua, hei waha kōrero hoki mō ngā take Katorika me ngā take o Airangi i muri i a Kelly, ēngari i āhua ngāwari kē āna mahi, kāore i kaha pākinakina, i taunanawe rānei pērā i mua rā. I noho anō te Tablet hei hautaka whakaawe tonu, motuhake i te wā o John Kennedy, te takatā mai i te tau 1967 ki 1989. I mōhiotia whānuitia ia hei kaikōrero tōrangapū, ā, e whakapono ana ētahi ko āna tautoko mō te Rōpū Reipa i te tau 1972, i whakapuakina i roto i te Tablet, tētahi take nui i tō rātou pōtitanga hei kāwanatanga i tērā tau.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I whakamutua te Tablet i te marama o Paenga-whāwhā 1996. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; The NZ Truth was for many years one of the country’s most colourful, controversial and popular newspapers. The Truth was launched, in Wellington, by the Australian newspaper publisher John Norton in June 1905.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Norton owned a stable of Truth newspapers in Australia, starting with the Sydney Truth in 1896. The Sydney Truth’s mix of radical politics and muck-raking proved very popular and Norton established similar papers in the other states before crossing the Tasman. In New Zealand he stuck with the same formula and achieved the same results. By 1930 the Truth was selling 100,000s of copies each week. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Truth stood out from the other New Zealand newspapers because it was overtly political and reported the unseemly aspects of life in immoderate prose. Under Robert Hogg, editor from 1913 to 1922, the paper was strongly socialist. It supported the revolutionary Industrial Workers of the World during the 1913 general strike, opposed conscription during the World War One and published letters from pacifist Archibald Baxter. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Truth’s politics moved right-wards in the 1920s after John Norton’s son Ezra assumed control. Hogg was dismissed and the paper took a more conservative and populist line from which it never deviated, attacking liberal causes with alacrity. However the commitment to investigative journalism and exposing political corruption remained. The paper was responsible for some major scoops in the next few decades. The Truth grew in popularity although not respectability, circulation reaching about 240,000 copies a week in the 1960s. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ezra Norton sold the Truth to a consortium of local businessmen in 1951. In 1978 Independent Newspapers acquired the paper and in 1982 they moved it to Auckland. Here the paper went into a sharp decline. Tabloid journalism was now the norm and the paper lost the vitality that being at the centre of politics had given it. Weekly sales were down to 12,500 when the paper was sold in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Note: no issues are known to exist of the first year of the NZ Truth. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Nō ngā tau maha ko te NZ Truth tētahi o ngā tino nūpepa tautohetohe o te motu. Nā te kaitā nūpepa nā John Norton o Ahitereiria te Truth i whakamāunu i Pōneke i te Hune o 1905. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Nā Norton te huinga nūpepa Truth i Ahitereiria, ko tōna tīmatanga mai i te Sydney Truth i Poihākena i te 1896. Ko tā te Sydney Truth kawe i te tuwhena tōrangapū me te kawe whawhewhawhe he mea ihiihi ki te iwi, ā, ka tūria ai e Norton ētahi nūpepa pērā puta noa ngā wehenga, kātahi ka whakawhiti mai Te Tai o Rehua. Ki Aotearoa ko tāna ko taua tū āhuatanga anō, ko aua hua anō. Tae noa ki te 1930, e hia nei ngā raumano kape o te Truth i te hokona. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; He mea rerekē atu te Truth i ētahi anō o ngā nūpepa o Aotearoa, te take he mea whakakite tōrangapū, ka tāngia hoki ngā mea anuanu o te wā ki ngā kupu haere hāngai tonu. I raro i a Robert Hogg, te etita mai i te 1913 ki te 1922, he kaha te ā-pāpori o te nūpepa. He mea tautoko i te rōpū whakawhana o ngā Industrial Workers of the World i te wā o te taraika whānui o te 1913, he mea tohe i te māperetanga o te Pakanga ā-Ao Tuatahi, he mea tā i ngā reta mai i te kairongomau, i a Archibald Baxter. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ka huri whakatekatau te tōrangapū o te Truth i ngā 1920, nō te rironga o te whakahaeretanga i te tama a John Norton, i a Ezra. Ka panaia atu a Hogg, ka huri, ka mau te nūpepa ki te tūpato, me te manako ā-iwi, ka kaha tonu te tohea o ngā take tōrangapū ngāwari. He oti rā, ka mau tonu tāna here ki te āta rangahau ā-nūpepa me te whakaraerae i te hēnga. Nāna ētahi whakaputanga nui whakaharahara i roto i ngā tekautau o muri mai. Ka tupu, ka tupu te manako ā-iwi, ēngari mō te tirohanga ki te whāia o te tika, ko te hokonga ka eke ki te 240,000 ngā kape i tētahi wiki kotahi i ngā 1960. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ka hokona te Truth e Ezra Norton ki tētahi rōpū kaipakihi o te takiwā i te 1951. Nō te 1978 ka riro te nūpepa i a Independent Newspapers, ā, nō te 1982, ka nukuhia ai ki Ākarana. Nō konei ka tere heke te nūpepa. Ko ta tānga nūpepa whakaparahako he āhuatanga aunoa, ka ngaro i te nūpepa taua hīkaka o tōna wā i te pokapū o ngā take tōrangapū. Ke heke haere ngā hokonga ki te 12,500 i tōna hokonga i te 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Tēnā: kāore i te kitea tētahi putanga o te tau tuatahi o te NZ Truth. &lt;/p&gt;

    <Essay language="en">
    &lt;p&gt; It is thought that the Oamaru Mail (first called the Evening Mail) began in order to express opposing views to those being expounded in the North Otago Times about the abolition of the New Zealand provincial system. William J Steward, who owned the North Otago Times between 1870 and 1897, at times in partnership with others, supported the abolition of the provincial system. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Steward was a Member of Parliament for the single-seat Waitaki electorate from 1871-1875, but lost the next election to two provincialists in the then, two-seat electorate.  He returned to Parliament in 1881 and was Speaker of the House of Representatives from 1891-1893. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Because there was considerable support for the provincial system, particularly in the far south of the country, a group of prominent Oamaru residents decided they would begin a new daily newspaper to promote this, which they did in April 1876.  However, the North Otago Times, first as the bi-weekly Oamaru Times and Waitaki Reporter, then as a tri-weekly, became a daily at the beginning of January 1876, pre-empting the new opposition by three months. Further, there was an inauspicious launch for the Evening Mail when its second-hand machinery broke down. As often happened in the early days of newspapering in New Zealand, the North Otago Times obliged by printing its rival’s first issue. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;  It was doubtful whether Oamaru’s small population could support two dailies. The township had been surveyed as recently as 1860 and it grew slowly as an agricultural/pastoral service centre until, with the construction of a breakwater in the early 1870s, it became a major port for the region. Certainly, the Evening Mail found the going hard and in early 1877, the provincial system now legislated out of existence, the original Evening Mail Company was wound up. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; At this point George Jones arrived in Oamaru, following his founding of and brief association with the Evening News in Dunedin, and bought the paper. Born in New Zealand but apprenticed in Australia, Jones was printer of the Auckland Star before launching the Waikato Times in 1872 and the short-lived Echo in Auckland two years later. It took a cause célèbre to put the Evening Mail on a firmer financial footing. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In 1877 the paper accused politician Sir Frederick Whitaker of having a personal interest in native land his planned legislation would make available for sale. Jones was summoned to the bar of the House of Representatives and then prosecuted for criminal libel. He was acquitted, the legislation withdrawn and the Ministry defeated shortly afterwards. The Evening Mail had successfully underscored the ‘freedom of the press’ principle and the attendant publicity provided the paper with a surge of reader and advertiser support. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Oamaru Mail, as it was now called, could afford to take up, with other evening papers, a special telegraphic service originated by the Dunedin Evening Star and was one of the early papers outside metropolitan areas to install linotype machines. In 1909 the Oamaru Mail business was formed into a private company, at about the same time as George Jones bought the Southland News. He and his sons continued to play a prominent part in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;  Jones also had a lengthy political career. He briefly represented Waitaki in the House of Representatives in the early 1880s and was a member of the Legislative Council for a quarter century from 1895. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; According to the Cyclopedia of New Zealand [Otago &amp; Southland Provincial Districts] in 1905: 
‘The first edition of the ‘Mail’ is published daily at 3 p.m., and is timed for despatch by various trains. The journal is a four page paper of twenty-eight columns, and has a daily circulation of 2,100 copies throughout the North Otago and South Canterbury districts. The ‘Oamaru Mail’ office is centrally situated in Tyne Street. It is a two-storey stone building, which was erected for the domicile of the paper. A water motor, supplied from the corporation water works, and a gas engine drive the plant, which consists of a two-feeder double royal Wharfdale machine, two Platen machines, three linotypes, and other up-to-date appliances, besides an ancient machine on which, it is said, the first issue of the ‘Melbourne Age’ was printed and also the first issue of the ‘Otago Daily Times’.’
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Oamaru Mail was owned by descendants of the Jones family until the 1970s when it was bought by NZ News Ltd, a Brierley subsidiary, then by Wilson and Horton which, in turn, was sold to APN NZ Media. In November 2011, the Oamaru Mail became a five-mornings-a-week tabloid paper. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In 2013, the Oamaru Mail was bought by a private, family-owned Christchurch company, Mainland Media Ltd. The company also bought the Christchurch Star and six other community newspapers in the greater Christchurch area previously owned by APN. Charlotte Smulders, co-owner with her husband, is a member of the Smith family which controls Allied Press and the Otago Daily Times. The Oamaru Mail has a paid circulation of about 2,900 copies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Essay language="mi">
    &lt;p&gt; E ai ki ngā mea mōhio i tīmataria te Oamaru Mail (i karangatia ko te Evening Mail i tōna tuatahitanga) hei hoa tauwhāinga ki ngā whakaaro i kauwhautia ai i roto i te North Otago Times mō te whakakorenga i te pūnaha kāwanatanga ā-porowini o Aotearoa. I tautoko a William J Steward i te whakakorenga o te pūnaha kāwanatanga ā-porowini. Koia te tangata nāna te North Otago Times i waenga i ngā tau 1870 me 1897, otirā, arā hoki ana hoa i roto i te nūpepa i ētahi o aua tau. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; He mema Pāremata a Steward mō te tūru takitahi o Waitaki mai i 1871-1875, engari i hinga i roto i te pōti whai i muri ki ētahi toa tokorua nō te porowini mō te tūru, kua tūru takirua hoki i taua wā.  Ka hoki ia ki te Pāremata i te tau 1881 ā, koia te Kaikōrero i te Whare Pāremata mai i 1891-1893. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Nā te mea he nui te tautoko mō te pūnaha kāwanatanga ā-rohe, otirā ko te rohe tino whaka-te-tonga o Aotearoa te rohe kaha ki te whakaaro pērā, ka whakatau tētahi rōpū tāngata mana-nui i Oamaru ki te tīmata i tētahi nūpepa o ia rā ki te whakatairanga i taua whakaaro, ā, ka pērā anō i te marama o Āperira 1876.  Ahakoa rā, ka tīmata wawe te North Otago Times, hei nūpepa o ia rā i te tīmatanga o 1876, e toru marama i mua i te hoa tauwhāinga. I mua he nūpepa e rua ana putanga i te wiki, ko te ingoa ko Oamaru Times and Waitaki Reporter, ā, i muri e toru ana putanga i te wiki, ka huri hei nūpepa o ia rā. I tua atu i tērā, i aituā te whakarewanga o te Evening Mail i te pakarutanga o ana mīhini kua hokona mai i ētahi atu nūpepa. Rite tonu ki te mahi a te tini o ngā nūpepa tuatahi o Aotearoa, i whakaae tana hoa tauwhāinga te North Otago Times ki te tā i te putanga tuatahi o tana hoa tauwhāinga. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;  Ki te whakaaro ake kāore pea te taupori o Oamaru i rahi kia ora ngā nūpepa e rua. Nō nakua noa nei te tāone i rūritia ai i te tau 1860, ā, i āta tupu hei pūtahi ahuwhenua, taea noatia te hanganga o tētahi kawa wahapū i ngā tau tuatahi mai i  1870, i piki ai te tāone hei wahapū matua mō te rohe. Arā, he uaua te huarahi mā te Evening Mail ā, i te tau 1877 ka whakamutua te Evening Mail Company. Kua whakakorea hoki te pūnaha kāwanatanga ā-porowini i raro i te ture i taua wā. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I konei ka tae mai a George Jones ki Oamaru, i muri i tana whakatūranga i te  Evening News i Ōtepoti, me te hoko i te nūpepa. I whānau mai i Aotearoa, engari i ākona ki tana mahi i Āhitereiria. He kaitā a Jones mō te Auckland Star i mua i tana whakarewanga i te Waikato Times i te tau 1872 me te  Echo i Tāmaki-makau-rau e rua tau i muri mai. Nā tētahi take nui whakahirahira ngā pūtea o te Evening Mail i whakamōmona. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1877 ka whakapae te pepa he pānga tō te kaitōrangapū rongonui a Sir Frederick Whitaker ki ngā whenua Māori meāke ka whakawāteatia mō te hoko i raro i āna ture hou. Ka ngarea a Jones ki te pae whakawā o te Whare Pāremata, kātahi ka hāmenetia mō te hāhani nanakia i te ingoa pai o te tangata. Ka kīia he hara-kore ia, me te aha, ka tangohia te pire, ka hinga hoki te Kāwanatanga i muri tata tonu iho. Kua whakaūngia te mātāpono o te 'noho wātea o te perehi ki te mahi i tana mahi' e te Evening Mail ā, ka piki tōna mana i waenga i te iwi, me te tautoko mai anō hoki o ngā kaipānui me ngā kaiwhakatairanga. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Kua wātea te Oamaru Mail, (tana ingoa hōu), ki te tīmata i tētahi ratonga tarikarāwhe i takea mai i te Dunedin Evening Star ā, koia tētahi o ngā nūpepa tuatahi i waho i ngā tāone nunui kia whakauru mai i ngā mīhini linotype. I te tau 1909 ka whakapūmautia te umanga o te Oamaru Mail hei kamupene tūmataiti, i te wā tonu i hoko a George Jones i te Southland News. I haere tonu ā rātou mahi hihiri ko ana tama i roto i te kamupene. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; He roa tonu hoki te wā o Jones i roto i ngā mahi tōrangapū. Ka uru ia hei kanohi mō te Whare Pāremata mō te tūnga o Waitaki i ngā tau tuatahi o te Whare Pāremata o ngā tau tuatahi mai i 1880 ā, he mema hoki nō te Kaunihera Hanga Ture mō te rua tekau tau mai i 1895. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; E ai ki te Cyclopedia of New Zealand [Otago &amp; Southland Provincial Districts] i 1905: 
‘Puta ai te putanga tuatahi o te ‘Mail’ ia rā, ia rā hei te 3 p.m, ko tōna tikanga ka tukua atu mā runga i ngā tereina e tika ana. E whā ngā whārangi o te nūpepa, e rua tekau mā waru ngā tīwae, ko ngā nūpepa ka hokona ia rā e 2,100 puta noa i ngā rohe o Ōtākou ki te Raki me Waitaki. Ko te tari o te ‘Oamaru Mail’ kei waenga pū i te Tiriti o Tyne. He whare paparanga rua, he mea āta whakatū mārire hei kāinga mō te nūpepa. He pūkaha wai, he pūkahu kapuni hoki ngā mea e pana ana i ōna mīhini, he mea whāngai ki ngā wai o te kāporeihana. Ko aua mīhini he mīhini whāngai-rua  Wharfdale pūrua, e rua ngā mīhini Platen, e toru ngā linotype, me tētahi atu mīhini tino hou, me tētahi mīhini tawhito, e kīa ana nāna i tā te putanga tuatahi o te ‘Melbourne Age’ me te putanga tuatahi o te ‘Otago Daily Times’.’
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ko ngā rangatira o te Oamaru Mail he uri nō te whānau Jones taea noatia ngā tau 1970 i hokona mai ai e NZ News Ltd, he pekanga nā Brierley. I muri ka hokona e Wilson and Horton ā, ka hokona hoki tērā ki APN NZ Media. I te marama o Nōema 2011, ka huri te Oamaru Mail he nūpepa rima-ata-i-te-wiki. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I te tau 2013, ka hokona te Oamaru Mail e tētahi kamupena ā-whānau tūmataiti nō Ōtautahi arā, e Mainland Media Ltd. I hokona hoki e te kamupene te Christchurch Star, me ētahi atu nūpepa hapori e ono i te rohe whānui o Ōtautahi, ko APN tō mua rangatira. He kaipupuri hea ngātahi a Charlotte Smulders, me tana tāne, he mema nō te whānau Smith e noho nei hei rangatira mō te Allied Press me te Otago Daily Times. Ko te maha o ngā kaipānui o te Oamaru Mail e utu ana mō te nūpepa kei te 2,900 ngā kape. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Based in Paeroa, the first issue of the Ohinemuri Gazette appeared on Saturday, 19 December 1891. It appeared twice a week, on Saturday and Wednesday mornings and was hand-set. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Founder Edwin Edwards arrived in Paeroa in the early 1880s and started off his newspaper career by founding  the Gazette with J.H. Moore and H.C. Wick, then in 1896, the Te Aroha Times and Waiorongomai Advocate, with J.W. Parry. He was an amateur geologist who at one time owned part of the Waihi Mine, was active in local affairs and was a writer of ballads, which often appeared in the Ohinemuri Gazette. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ownership was taken over in 1900 by William Dennis Nicholas and Henry Howard Lyes (retired 1901). Nicholas changed the Gazette to an evening paper, appearing three times a week. Fire swept through the Wharf St office of the Gazette in 1908, but it continued to be published (printed by the owner of Waihi Times). New printing premises were opened in Princes St with an up-to-date press. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Hauraki Tribune was incorporated into the Ohinemuri Gazette in 1896, with a title change in 1921 to the Hauraki Plains Gazette. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Hauraki Plains Gazette was incorporated into the Thames Valley Gazette in 1977, with two other local newspapers, and then it became the Paeroa Gazette in 1988. This merged with the Thames Star in 1998 to become the Thames Valley Gazette, but the new publication lasted less than a year. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; I puta te putanga tuatahi o te Ohinemuri Gazette o Paeroa i te Hātarei, te 19 o ngā rā o Tīhema 1891. E rua rawa ōna putanga ia wiki, i Hātarei, ia Wenerei hoki, i te ata, ā, he mea tā ā-ringa ōna reta. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I tae mai te kaiwhakatū o te nūpepa a  Edwin Edwards ki Paeroa i ngā tau tuatahi mai i 1880, ā, i tīmata tāna mahi nūpepa ki te whakatū i te Gazette i te taha o J.H.Moore me H.C. Wick, ā, nō te tau 1896, ka whakatūria e ia Te Aroha Times and Waiorongomai Advocate, i te taha o J.W. Parry. He kaimātai whenua kore-utu noa ia, ā, tērā anō te wā nōna tētahi wāhi o te keringa nui o Waihī, he tangata i hautū i ngā mahi o te rohe, he tautitotito ruriruri, ā, he maha ōna ruriruri i puta i te Ohinemuri Gazette. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I riro te mana pupuri i a William Dennis Nicholas rāua ko Henry Howard Lyes (i tukua e ia tōna tūranga i te tau 1901). Ka hurihia e Nicholas te āhua o te Gazette hei pepa mō te ahiahi, e toru ōna putanga i te wiki.I kainga ngā tari o te Gazette i Wharf St e te ahi i te tau 1908, heoi anō, ka puta haere tonu (he mea tā e te hunga nō ratou te Waihi Times). Ka whakatuwheratia ētahi whare tā i  Princes St, ka whakaurungia he mīhini tā hōu ki roto. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Nō te tau 1896 ka haumitia te Hauraki Tribune ki roto i te Ohinemuri Gazette, ā, nō te tau 1921 ka hurihia te ingoa ki te Hauraki Plains Gazette. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ka haumitia mai te Hauraki Plains Gazette ki roto i te Thames Valley Gazette i te tau 1977, me ētahi atu nūpepa ā-rohe e rua, ā, ka kīia i muri ko Paeroa Gazette i te tau 1988. Ka haumitia mai  tēnei ki te Thames Star i te tau 1998, ka kīia ko Thames Valley Gazette, engari kāore i eke ki te tau te oranga o te nūpepa hou.  &lt;/p&gt;

The first issue appeared on 15 November 1861, making it the first daily newspaper in New Zealand, and the one with the longest history of daily publication. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Vogel’s support for separating the South and North Islands led to his dismissal in 1868, leaving him to concentrate on national politics, whilst always retaining an interest in journalism. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; After a merger of the Otago Guardian and the Otago Daily Times, a public company, The Otago Daily Times and Witness Company, was floated in 1878. One of the highlights of the paper’s history is the exposure of working conditions in Dunedin sweatshops in the 1880s by chief reporter Silas Spragg  and editor George Fenwick. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Nearly a century later the Otago Daily Times Ltd and the Evening Star Company Ltd merged in 1975, followed within a few years by the transformation of the Evening Star into a community newspaper. This left the Otago Daily Times as the city’s only daily newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

         weekly newspapers that were a popular and important form of publication 
         in New Zealand in the 19th and early 20th centuries. They were 
         particularly popular in isolated rural areas where poor access prevented 
         newspapers being delivered daily. These papers were the main medium 
         for published illustrations and photographs. Others examples include 
         the Weekly News (Auckland) and the New Zealand Free Lance (Wellington).&lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt;The Witness began in 1851 as a four page, fortnightly newspaper and 
         started publishing weekly in August that year. The Witness took its 
         title from the Edinburgh Witness, which was a popular journal in 
         Scotland. In its early years the Witness took a high moral stance. 
         However it was actually insulting, vindictive and highly biased in 
         the way that it helped William Cargill (leader of the Otago Association, 
         the branch of the New Zealand Company responsible for the initial 
         settlement of Otago), fight his political opponents. Over time it 
         settled down and became an inoffensive journal that was widely 
         distributed, particularly in the South Island.&lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt;At first the Otago Witness struggled to pay its way. In 1855 the 
         paper had only 210 subscribers but by 1864 the paper was printing 
         4,500 copies a week. The newspaper's fortunes were secured in the 
         1860s by the influx of people into Otago looking for gold. The 
         Witness also published an edition especially for the goldfields.&lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt;During this time the paper's popularity was further improved by 
         introducing illustrations. Initially these were engravings but 
         around 1900 the Witness started using photographs on an insert. 
         The illustrated content increased considerably over time.&lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt;Although the Witness was probably the most conservative of the 
         pictorial weeklies it provided an important outlet for New Zealand 
         writers by regularly publishing poetry and short stories.&lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt;Like the other New Zealand weekly newspapers the Witness was adversely 
         affected by the increasing development of rural land as well as 
         competition from broadcasting. The paper stopped publication in 1932.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;He tino tauira te Otago Witness o ngā nūpepa ā-wiki whai whakaahua, he tūmomo whakaputanga nui, i paingia hoki i Aotearoa i te rau tau 1800-1899 me te tīmatanga o te rau tau 1900-1999. He mea tino pai i ngā wāhi taratahi nā te koretake o ngā rori i kore ai e taea te tuku ia rā. Ko ēnei nūpepa te mea nui mō te whakaputa pikitia, whakaahua hoki. Ko ētahi atu tauira ko te Weekly News (ākarana) me te New Zealand Free Lance (Pōneke).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ka tīmata te Witness i te tau 1851, e whā ōna whārangi, he nūpepa o ia rua wiki, ā, ka tīmata te whakaputa ia wiki i te marama o Here-turi-kōkā i taua tau. Nō te Edinburgh Witness tōna ingoa, he nūpepa i paingia i Kotirana. I ōna tau tīmatanga, he tūnga whanonga tika teitei rawa atu tōna. Heoi, he whakaiti, he mauāhara, he kino nō te rītaha ki te tautoko i a William Cargill (te kaihautū o te Otago Association, arā, te peka o te Kamupene o Niu Tīreni nāna te whakanohonoho tuatahi o te Pākehā i ōtākou) me tāna whakataetae ki ōna hoariri tōrangapū. Nāwai rā ka tau te puehu, ka huri hei nūpepa ngāwari i whakaputaina whānui, ki te Waipounamu rā anō.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I te tīmatanga he uaua te utu a te Otago Witness i āna nama. I te tau 1855, e 210 noa iho ana kaiutu, engari i te tau 1864 e 4,500 ngā kape kei te tāngia i ia wiki. Ka mau i te tekau tau mai i 1860 nā te urutanga mai o Hōpara i ngā pānuitangata ki ōtākou ki te kimi kōura. He putanga ake anō tā te Witness mā ngā whīra kōura.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I taua wā i kaha ake te paingia o te nūpepa i te whakauru whakaahua. I te tīmatanga he mea āhua whakairo, ēngari i te tau 1900 pea, ka tīmata te whakauru whārangi whakaahua. Nāwai rā ka kaha haere ake ngā whakaahua.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He ahakoa ko te Witness te nūpepa tino whakatūpato o ngā nūpepa ā-wiki whai whakaahua, i a ia tonu tētahi wāhi nui mō ngā kaituhi o Aotearoa i tāna whakaputa whiti me te pitopito kōrero.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I āhua raruraru anō te Witness, pērā me ētahi atu o ngā nūpepa ā-wiki whai whakaahua i Aotearoa, i te kaha ake o te ahuwhenua me te whakataetae mai a te whakapāho irirangi. Ka mutu tana whakaputa i te tau 1932.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;N.Z. Building Progress was New Zealand’s first architectural periodical. Published in Wellington from 1905 to 1924 and heavily illustrated with photos, drawings and plans, it is an essential resource for the study of architecture and building in New Zealand in the early twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was initially published by Wellington patent attorneys, Baldwin &amp; Rayward under the title of Progress. Its first issue in 1905 promised to "treat of progress in engineering, processes, inventions, industrial work and economics as applied to any of these subjects."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1910 the magazine was taken over by Harry Tombs (1874-1966). Tombs, son of Whitcombe &amp; Tombs founder George Tombs, was a well-known printer, patron of the arts and publisher of fine arts periodicals. Progress was the first of his magazines; the best known was probably Art in New Zealand (1928-44).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under Tombs Progress focused on architecture and building; this was signalled by a change of title in 1914 to N.Z.Building Progress. This specialisation was identified by the publishers in the final issue (April 1924) as one of the reasons why they were suspending publication. It was intimated that publication would resume when "conditions become more favourable". However Progress was not restarted. Instead, in 1926, Tombs published another architectural magazine, New Zealand Architectural and Building Review. This lasted until Tombs started Art in New Zealand two years later.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ko te N.Z. Building Progress te hautaka hoahoanga whare tuatahi o Niu Tireni.

    &lt;p&gt;I whakaputaina tuatahitia e ngā rōia whakamana ārai o Te Whanga-nui-a-Tara, e Baldwin &amp; Rayward mā, i raro i te ingoa Progress. I oati te tānga tuatahi o 1905 ki te "whāki i te nekenga whakamua o te pūkahatanga, te tukanga, te tenenga, ngā mahi ahumahi, me te ohaoha e hāngai ana ki tētahi o ēnei take".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I te tau 1910 ka taumanutia te NZ Building Progress e Harry Tombs (1874-1966). Ko Tombs (te tama o te kaiwhakaū o Whitcombe &amp; Tombs, a George Tombs), tētahi kaiwhakatā rongonui, he kaitautoko o ngā mahi toi, he kaiwhakaputa hoki i ngā hautaka toi. Ko Progress te tuatahi o āna hautaka; ko te mea tino rongonui pea ko Art in New Zealand (1928-44).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I raro i a Tombs ko te hoahoanga me te hanganga whare te arotahi o Progress, otirā i tohua hoki tēnei mā te whakawhitinga o te ingoa ki NZ Building Progress i te tau 1914. I roto i te tānga whakamutunga (o Paenga-whāwhā 1924), i tūtohutia e ngā kaiwhakaputa ko tēnei whakawhāititanga tētahi take i te whakatārewatia e rātou te hautaka. I whakaatu noa ka tīmata anō te pānuitanga ina "pai haere anō ngā āhuatanga". Heoi, kīhai te Progress i tīmata anō. Engari, i te tau 1926, ka whakaputaina e Tombs tētahi atu hautaka hoahoanga whare, New Zealand Architectural and Building Review. I whakaputaina tonutia tēnei tae noa ki te tīmatanga a Tombs i te Art in New Zealand e rua tau i muri mai.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;The owners of Napier's Hawke's Bay Herald, in partnership with others, set up the Poverty Bay Herald. The first issue of this bi-weekly morning paper was published in Gisborne on 5 January 1874. When the paper started publication Gisborne already had a newspaper, the Poverty Bay Standard (1872-1883).&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Like most New Zealand newspapers in the 19th century, it took the Herald some time to get established. In 1879 the paper nearly went into liquidation when the City of Glasgow Bank failed. However the Herald started to flourish in the 1880s. It proved too strong for its competitor, the Standard, which folded in 1883.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The outright acquisition of the paper in 1884 by Allan Ramsay Muir gave it stability. Muir's father had worked on the earliest New Zealand newspaper, the New Zealand Gazette as well as being one of the founders of the Wellington Independent (one of the country's most distinctive papers). Muir started working at the Herald in 1880 as a printer. He became a partner in 1883 and sole owner the year after. His descendants are still involved in the management of the paper today.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;There were a number of other papers published in Gisborne before 1940. The most noteworthy is the Gisborne Times (1896-1938) but none of them were able to compete with the Herald. In 1938 the Herald absorbed the Times and the following year the paper changed its name to the Gisborne Herald.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The paper is still published and is one of the last privately operated daily newspapers in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

Ka whakaputaina te tukunga tuatahi o tēnei nūpepa o te ata, e rua Hōpara i ngā pānuitanga i ia wiki, i Tūranga i te 5 o Kohitātea 1874. I tana tīmatanga ki te puta, i a Tūranga kē tētahi nūpepa, ko te Poverty Bay Standard (1872-1883).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pērā me te nuinga o ngā nūpepa o Aotearoa i te rau tau 1800-1899, ka āhua roa te mau pai o te Herald. I te tau 1879, ka tata toremi te pepa i te hinganga o te pēke City of Glasgow Bank. Heoi anō, ka tīmata te puāwai i te tekau tau mai i 1880. He kaha rawa ia mō tōna hoa whakataetae, te Standard, i katia i te tau 1883.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nā te rironga tonu atu o te pepa i a Allan Ramsay Muir i te tau 1884 i pūmau ai. I te mahi te pāpā o Muir mā tētahi o ngā nūpepa tuatahi o Aotearoa, te New Zealand Gazette, koia hoki tētahi o ngā kaiwhakaū o te Wellington Independent (tētahi o ngā nūpepa tino kōhure o te motu). Ka tīmata te mahi a Muir i te Herald i te tau 1880 hei kaitā. Ka huri hei hoa kaipakihi ia i te tau 1883, ā, i te tau o muri mai koia anahe te rangatira. E mahi tonu ana ōna uri i roto i ngā whakahaere o te nūpepa i tēnei rā.&lt;/p&gt;

I te tau 1938 ka tōia mai te Times i raro i a ia, ā, nō te tau o muri mai ka hurihia te ingoa ki te Gisborne Herald.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; The Pukekohe &amp; Waiuku Times (later known as the Franklin Times), one of South Auckland’s longest-lasting local newspapers, was published in Pukekohe from 1912 to 1971.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; On 8 March 1912 Pukekohe businessmen Richard Eames and William Cargill brought out the first issue of the Pukekohe &amp; Waiuku Times. The new tabloid was just four pages long and came out once a week. As demand grew it increased in size and frequency, becoming bi-weekly from 1 October 1912 and tri-weekly from 5 July 1915. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Franklin Printing &amp; Publishing Company acquired the Pukekohe &amp; Waiuku Times in November 1914. The new owners changed the title to the Franklin &amp; Pukekohe Times on 2 September 1919, then to the Franklin Times on 1 February 1921.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Despite the changes of title, the volume numbering remained consistent throughout. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The changes of title in part reflected broadening coverage. The original masthead shows the paper aimed to include Pukekohe, Waiuku, Mercer, Tuakau, Drury, Papakura and Bombay news. It then sought to reach into all parts of Franklin County. For some years it included a Papakura section on the back page, and sometimes also included Otahuhu and Manurewa news. In later years coverage reached southward across the Waikato River to include news from the northern parts of Raglan County. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; A short-lived companion title, the Pukekohe &amp; Otahuhu Times came out between 13 April 1917 and 28 December 1917. A later companion title, the Tuakau and District Times, lasted from 10 March 1932 to 14 September 1939. In November 1964 the Franklin Times absorbed its almost equally long-lived small-town rival, the Waiuku News. (The 1965 masthead read: 'The Franklin Times, incorporating the Waiuku News. Circulating in the whole of Franklin County and parts of Raglan and Manukau Counties').&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The last issue of the Franklin Times came out on 19 January 1971. It was then merged with the South Auckland News Advertiser to form the Franklin Times Advertiser. However, after a subsequent merger with the South Auckland Courier, the Franklin Times was revived as a stand-alone title between April 1974 and July 1979. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; I te 8 Māehe 1912 nā ēnei tāngata kaipakihi o Pukekohe nā Richard Eames rāua ko William Cargill i whakaputa te putanga tuatahi o te Pukekohe &amp; Waiuku Times.

E ai ki te panekōrero tuatahi o te pepa ko tāna whāinga kia kapi katoa ngā rongo kōrero o Pukekohe, o Waiuku, o Mercer, o Tuakau, o Drury, o Papakura me Bombay.

    &lt;p&gt; I puta mai hoki tētahi nūpepa whakahoa, te Pukekohe &amp; Otahuhu Times he nupepa i puta i waenga i te 13 Aperira 1917 me te 28 Tīhema 1917.

(Tērā te kōrero a te Panekōrero o 1965: ‘The Franklin Times, incorporating the Waiuku News. Circulating in the whole of Franklin County and parts of Raglan and Manukau Counties’).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I puta mai te putanga whakamutunga o te Franklin Times i te 19 Hānuere 1971. Kātahi ka whakahanumitia ki roto i te South Auckland News Advertiser kia tū mai te Franklin Times Advertiser. Ahakoa rā, i muri i tētahi whakahanumitanga ki te South Auckland Courier, i whakaorangia mai te Franklin Times hei taitara tū motuhake i waenga i te marama o Āperira 1974 me te marama o Hūrae 1979. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Australian Charles de La Roche began the newspaper in 1901. After his first foray into newspaper ownership with the short-lived Tauranga Herald in 1899, he moved to Warkworth and quickly established a successful real estate business. He also bought a poorly performing paper, the Gazette, ostensibly serving the Waitemata and Kaipara areas, and used its press to launch Warkworth’s first newspaper. The masthead read Rodney and Otamatea Times, but the secondary heading, Waitemata and Kaipara Gazette, suggested de La Roche had hopes of retaining some readership there. It did not help his cause that the first issue made no mention of either area. &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; The weekly Rodney and Otamatea Times, a four-page broadsheet, was printed on a Furnival flat-bed press. Two casual workers shared the job of turning the large wheel by hand while the printer fed sheets of newsprint to the rollers. The newspaper, published on Fridays, sold for 3d a copy, and the annual subscription was eight shillings. The Times soon acquired a reputation for its reporting and comment on local politics, but sporting enthusiasts found coverage disappointing. &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; After de La Roche sold the newspaper to A H Mason late in 1903, his real estate and property activities thrived. He later edited the Manukau Gazette in Onehunga where he retired, dying in 1938. &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; The Times had a number of other owners before Wairarapa printer William Cook bought the paper in 1917, the beginning of a three generation publishing dynasty that was to last 88 years. William Cook was editor until his death in 1942. His son Elsley, a former banker and World War One veteran, succeeded him in the editor’s chair and in running the company. Following his unexpected death in 1955, aged 62, his wife Marjorie headed the company until 1976, buying two opposition papers and withstanding a takeover bid from Wilson and Horton. Their son, Tony Cook, took over as managing director and, converting to web-offset, significantly developed the company’s commercial printing activities. The Times shifted from a paid subscription to free distribution model. &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; In 2005 the Cook family sold the twice-weekly Rodney Times to Fairfax New Zealand.&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Nā tētahi tangata nō Ahitereiria nā Charles de La Roche te niupepa i tīmata i te tau 1901. I muri i tāna hounga tuatahi ki ngā mahi pupuri niupepa, arā i  te Tauranga Herald i ora mō te wā poto noa iho i te tau 1899, ka nuku ia ki  Warkworth, ā, he tere tonu tana whakatū umanga hoko whenua, hoko kāinga whai painga. Ka hokona e ia tētahi niupepa āhua korekaha, e kīia nei te Gazette, tōna tikanga hei niupepa mō ngā rohe o  Waitemata me Kaipara, ā, ka whakamahia e ia tāna mīhini tā hei whakarewa i te niupepa tuatahi o Warkworth. Ko te taitara ko te Rodney and Otamatea Times, engari ko te taitara o raro ko te Waitemata and Kaipara Gazette, e whakaaro ai pea te tangata i te wawata a de La Roche kia kitea he kaipānui i taua takiwā. Hei whakararu pea i tāna mahi, kāore he kupu kotahi i te putanga tuatahi mō tētahi o aua rohe e rua.&lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; He rau whānui, he whā whārangi hoki te niupepa ā-wiki Rodney and Otamatea Times, i tāia ki tētahi mīhini pāraharaha Furnival. Tokorua ngā kaimahi mahi harangotengote i kawe ngā mahi hurihuri ā-ringa i te wīra nui, i te kaitā e whāngai ana i ngā pepa niupepa pātea ki roto i ngā rango. Puta ai te niupepa ia Paraire, ko te utu he 3d (toru kapa) mō te kape kotahi, ko te utu ā-tau e waru herengi. Ka piki te ingoa o te Times mō ana mahi kawe kōrero me āna whakaputanga kupu mō ngā take o te rohe, engari kāore i tino nui ngā kōrero mō ngā mahi hākinakina mā te hunga ngākaunui ki ēnā mahi.&lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; I muri i te hokonga a de La Roche i te niupepa ki A H Mason i ngā marama whakamutunga o 1903, ka tupu tuawhiti tonu āna mahi hoko whenua, hoko rawa. Nō muri ka noho ia hei ētita mō te Manukau Gazette i Onehunga i tuku ai ia i tana tūranga, ka mate rawa i te tau 1938.&lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; Arā atu anō ngā rangatira o te Times i mua i te hokonga o te pepa e tētahi kaitā nō Wairarapa e William Cook i te tau 1917, i tīmata ai tētahi umanga tā niupepa tuku iho i toitū tonu mō te 88 tau. I noho tonu ko William Cook te ētita taea noatia tōna matenga i te tau 1942. Ka piki tana tama a Elsley, he kaimahi pēke i mua, he toa tū taua i te Pakanga Tuatahi o Te Ao, ki tōna tūru ētita, kaiwhakahaere hoki i te kamupene. Nō muri i tana matenga ohorere i te tau 1955, e 62 ōna tau, ka eke tāna wahine a Marjorie ki te tūnga kaiwhakahaere i te kamupene tae noa ki 1976. I huri ia ki te hoko i ētahi pepa tauwhāinga e rua, ā, i tū pakari hoki ia ki te ārai i tētahi kōkiri hoko i te umanga nā Wilson and Horton. I riro nā tā rāua tama, Tony Cook, i whakahaere te kamupene hei kaihautū whakahaere, ā, ka hurihia e ia ki te tikanga web-offset, nā ana mahi i tino whanake nui ai ngā mahi tā arumoni o te kamupene. I huri te Times mai i te tētahi niupepa utu ā-tau ki tētahi niupepa tuari utu-kore.&lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; Nō te tau 2005 ka hokona e te whānau Cook te niupepa rua-wiki o te Rodney Times ki Fairfax New Zealand. &lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Southland Times has been published in Invercargill since 1862. Since 1968
      it has been Invercargill’s only daily newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;The Times was set up by Gerard George Fitzgerald, John T. Downes and Charles
        Reynolds and published its first issue on 12 November 1862 under the
        title of the Invercargill Times.&lt;/p&gt;		
      &lt;p&gt;The Times was established to oppose the Southern News (later
        the Southland Daily News), another Invercargill newspaper. The Southern
        News had begun publication the year before and was regarded as a liberal
        paper. The Times represented more conservative opinions. 1862 also was
        a good time to start a newspaper in Invercargill because the town was
        prospering due to the discovery of gold in the Wakatipu that year. Invercargill
        was the main supply base for the goldfield.&lt;/p&gt;		
      &lt;p&gt;The history of the paper in the 1860s and 70s is similar to
        that of other newspapers in New Zealand at the time. The paper experienced
        financial difficulties, frequent changes of owner and the loss of plant
        and offices due to fire. The Times ceased publication for several months
        in 1864 after a fire destroyed its office. When it resumed publication
        in June that year it was under the new title of the Southland Times.&lt;/p&gt;		
      &lt;p&gt;In 1875 the Times became a daily. In 1878 fire destroyed the
        newspaper office again. As in 1864, the Times’ rival, the Southland News,
        helped the paper continue to publish by allowing the Times to use their
        presses. During this period the Times published a weekly edition for
        its rural readers; the Weekly Times ran from 1866 to 1933.&lt;/p&gt;		
      &lt;p&gt;In the 1880s the Times achieved stability and prosperity.
        This was due in large part to the very capable management provided by
        the paper’s owner, Robert Gilmour. Gilmour, who had assumed control of
        the paper in 1879, had been involved with the press in Invercargill since
        1864. He had briefly owned the Times in 1869, before taking over the
        Southland News. In the mid-1870s he had moved back to Scotland for several
        years. Upon returning to Invercargill in 1879 he acquired the Times for
        a second time.&lt;/p&gt;		
      &lt;p&gt;The Gilmour family owned and managed the paper until 1984,
        when it was sold to Independent Newspapers Limited.&lt;/p&gt;		
      &lt;p&gt;One of the features of the Times and one of the main reasons
        that it has endured is that it stayed abreast of developments in newspaper
        technology. In the 1900s it upgraded its plant twice with the introduction
        of linotypes and then rotary presses. It was the first newspaper in New
        Zealand outside of the main centres to employ rotary presses. In the
        1970s and 80s the Times was one of the first papers in New Zealand to
        use computer-driven newspaper technology.&lt;/p&gt;		
      &lt;p&gt;The Times approach to technological change is probably one
        of the main reasons that it eventually overtook its old rival the Southland
        Daily News. The Times acquired the News in 1967 and in 1968 replaced
        it with an evening edition of its own. The Times evening edition ceased in 1976.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Kua tāngia te Southland Times ki Waihopai (Invercargill) mai i te tau 1862. Koia anake tō Waihopai nūpepa ā-rangi mai i te tau 1968.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nā Gerard George Fitzgerald rātou ko John T. Downes, ko Charles Reynolds te Times i whakaū, ā, i whakatā tōna tānga tuatahi i te 12 o Whiringa-ā-rangi 1862 i raro i te ingoa o te Invercargill Times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I whakaū ai te Times hei tautohe ki te Southern News (nō muri mai ko te Southland Daily News), arā, tētahi atu nūpepa i Waihopai. Kua tīmata hoki te tānga o te Southern News i te tau i mua atu, ā, i tirohia hoki hei nūpepa whakaaro whānui. I tū te Times hei māngai mō ngā whakaaro tūpato. He wā pai tonu te tau 1862 hei tīmata i tētahi nūpepa i Waihopai, nōtemea i te tōnui haere te tāone i te kitenga o te kōura i Wakatipu i taua tau anō. Ko Waihopai te pokapū matua o ngā putunga mō te pārae kōura. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He rite tonu te hītori o te nūpepa, i roto i te huinga tau mai i 1860 ki te 1880, ki tō ētahi atu nūpepa o Aotearoa i taua wā. I mōhio te nūpepa ki ngā raruraru moni, ki ngā whakawhitinga rangatira, ki te ngaromanga o te taonga, o te tari hoki ki te ahi. I whakamutua te tānga o te Times ētahi marama maha i te tau 1864 i muri i te ngaromanga o tōna tari ki tētahi ahi. Nō ka tīmata anō tōna tānga i te marama o Pipiri o taua tau, i raro kē ia i te ingoa o te Southland Times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I te tau 1875 ka meinga hei nūpepa ā-rangi te Times. I te tau 1878 ka kāia anō te tari o te nūpepa e te ahi. Pērā anō i taka i te tau 1864, nā te tāwhai o te Times, arā, nā te Southland News a ia i āwhina kia haere tonu tana tānga mā te tukunga kia whakamahia e te Times ō rātou perehi. I taua wā hoki, i tāngia e te Times tētahi tānga ā-wiki mā ōna kaipānui o te taiwhenua; rere ana te Weekly Times mai i te tau 1866 ki 1933.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I te tekau tau mai i 1880 i tino ū ai te Times i whiwhi hoki i te tōnuitanga. He huanga matua tēnei nā te whakahaere tino pai tonu a Ropata Gilmour, te tangata nāna nei te nūpepa. I whai wāhi hoki a Gilmour, nāna rā i tango i te whakahaerenga o te Times i te tau 1879, ki te mahi tā nūpepa i Waihopai mai te tau 1864. Nāna hoki te Times mō tētahi wā poto i te tau 1869, i mua i tana taumanu i te Southland News. Tae rawa a waenganui tonu o te tekau tau mai i 1870, kua hoki anō a ia ki Koterana mō ētahi tau. Nō tana hokinga ki Waihopai i te tau 1879 ka hoko tuarua mai ai ia i te Times. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nā te whānau Gilmour te nūpepa, nā rātou hoki i whakahaere tae noa te tau 1984, nā ka hokona atu ki te kamupene Independent Newspapers Limited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ko tētahi āhuatanga o te Times, he take matua hoki tēnei i matatū ai ia, ko tana haere upane tahi ai me ngā whanaketanga o te hangarau tānga nūpepa. I ngā tau mai i 1900 e rua āna whakahoutanga i ōna mīhini, arā, mā te whakamahi i te perehi tā ā-rārangi (Linotype) i te tuatahi, i kō atu o te perehi hurihuri. Koia tonu te nūpepa tuatahi o Aotearoa, i waho tonu o ngā tāone matua, ki te whakamahi i te perehi hurihuri. I te rua tekau tau mai i 1970 ki te 1990, ko te Times tētahi o ngā nūpepa tuatahi o Aotearoa ki te whakamahi i te hangarau tānga nā te rorohiko i pana. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ko tō te Times āro ki ngā whitinga hangarau tētahi take matua pea i mahue rawa i a ia tōna tāwhai tawhito, a te Southland Daily News. I riro te News i a te Times i te tau 1967, ā, i te tau 1968 i whakakapia te News i tētahi tānga ahiahi ōna ake. I whakamutua te tānga ahiahi o te Times i te tau 1976. &lt;/p&gt;

    <Essay language="en">
    &lt;p&gt; In 1912, Edward C Huie resigned from editorship of the Press Company’s Evening News in Christchurch, frustrated that the proprietors were not interested in the young Australian’s ideas about livelier journalism and layout. The Evening News’ primary role was to carry news and advertisements too late for that day’s Press. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The 36-year-old Huie announced shortly afterwards his intention to launch a third evening paper, a competitor to the Evening News and the Lyttelton Times’ Star.  In October 1912 the NZPA reported that the Canterbury Publishing Company had been registered with a capital of £75,000 (about $11.75 million today). The report noted that Huie would be editor and the paper’s backers were ‘prominent supporters of the Reform [precursor to National] party’. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Sun, modelled on London’s Daily Mail, without the British popular press’s sensationalism, was launched in February 1914. It was an immediate success with Christchurch readers and advertisers.  Its reporting was energetic and there was much more illustration than common in New Zealand dailies of the time.  It also gave considerable encouragement to poets, short story writers and essayists. The Evening News closed in 1917 and the Sun was soon outstripping the Star in circulation. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Buoyed by this success, Huie convinced his directors to enter the lucrative Auckland newspaper market. A new company, Sun Newspapers Ltd, acquired the property of the Canterbury Publishing Company, and in March 1927 Auckland’s Sun was launched. Its journalistic approach appealed as much to Aucklanders as it had to Christchurch newspaper readers but the establishment costs in a much larger market and the deepening Depression were complicating factors. In 1929, the Brett Company, publishers of the Auckland Star, took over the Lyttelton Times Company. The merged company, New Zealand Newspapers Ltd, now owned Huie’s Auckland and Christchurch evening competitors. The ensuing pressure was too much and the Auckland Sun’s short, colourful life ended late in 1930 when New Zealand Newspapers bought the paper for about £62,000 ($6 million today.) &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The pressure intensified on Huie and the Sun in Christchurch, with the three newspaper companies discussing and rejecting a range of mergers and takeovers predicated on tacit agreement that four dailies were not sustainable, and one morning and one evening paper was desirable. In November 1934, both the Sun and Star halved their per copy price to one penny, with the Press following suit and picking up circulation that further weakened its evening competitors. With its losses mounting, the Sun directors – despite Huie’s desire to fight on – agreed to sell to New Zealand Newspapers in late May 1935. In early July the first issue of the Christchurch Star-Sun appeared. The evening daily retained this name until 1958 and was the Christchurch Star when it closed in 1991. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; From 1936 to 1939, Edward Huie was London representative of The Press. In 1940, he purchased, on behalf of a private company, the Hawke’s Bay Daily Mail, then in receivership. He managed and edited the newspaper until daily publication ended in June 1941. He died in Sydney in 1967. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1912, i tukua e Edward C Huie tāna tūranga etita mō te nūpepa o te Evening News a te Press Company o Ōtautahi, i runga i tana manawapā kāore ngā rangatira o te nūpepa i aronui ki ngā whakaaro o tēnei taitama nō Āhitereiria. Ko tana hiahia kia whakahoutia te nūpepa hei whakapiki i te pai me te hāngai o ngā pūrongo me te āhua o te nūpepa. Ko te mahi matua ia o te Evening News he kawe i ngā pitopito kōrero me ngā pānui kua tūreiti mō te Press o taua rā. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Nā te tangata nei nā Huie, 36 ōna tau, i whakapuaki tana hiahia ki te kōkiri i tētahi nūpepa ā-ahiahi tuatoru, hei hoa tauwhāinga mō te Evening News me te Star a te Lyttelton Times.  Nō te marama o Oketopa 1912 ka whakapuaki te NZPA kua rēhitatia te Canterbury Publishing Company me ōna moni punga £75,000 (tata ki te $11.75 miriona i ēnei rā). E ai ki te pūrongo ka noho ko Huie hei etita, ā, ko ngā tino kaihautū o te nūpepa' ‘he kaitautoko hira nō te rōpū tōrangapū Reform [te matua tēnei o te rōpū Nāhinara]’. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I whakarewaina te Sun i te marama o Pēpuere 1914. He mea whakatauira mai ki runga i te Daily Mail o Rānana, engari kāore i pērā rawa tana wairua whakapātaritari. I tino rawe te nūpepa ki ngā kaipānui me ngā kaiwhakatairanga o Ōtautahi.  He hihiri ana mahi kawe kōrero, ā, he nui noa atu ana pikitia i ō te nuinga o ngā nūpepa ā-rā o Aotearoa o aua wā.  He kaha hoki te nūpepa ki te poipoi i ngā kaitito ruriruri, i ngā kaituhi pūrākau poto me ngā kaituhi tuhinga kaupapa. I kati te Evening News i te tau 1917 ā, kāore i roa i muri mai kei mua noa atu te nūpepa te Sun i te nūpepa o te Star mō te maha o ngā kaipānui. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I runga i ēnei hua tino pai, ka akiaki a Huie i ōna hoa kaihautū kia kuhu ki te mākete nūpepa moni nui o Tāmaki-makau-rau. Nā tētahi kamupene hou nā Sun Newspapers Ltd, i hoko ngā rawa o te Canterbury Publishing Company, ā, i te marama o Māehe 1927 ka whakarewaina te Sun o Tāmaki-makau-rau. Ko āna tikanga kawe kōrero i tino pai ki ngā kaipānui o Tāmaki-makau-rau, rite tonu ki ngā kaipānui i Ōtautahi, engari he mea uaua ngā utunga mō te whakatū i a ia i taua mākete nui kē atu, waihoki ngā taimahatanga o te Tūpuhi Nui o te Ao, i te mātotoru haere ōna whakawhiu i taua wā. I te tau 1929, nā te Brett Company, te kaiwhakaputa o te Auckland Star, i piki mai hei rangatira mō te Lyttelton Times Company. Ka noho ko te kamupene hanumi, New Zealand Newspapers , Ltd, hei rangatira mō ngā hoa tauwhāinga i Tāmaki me Ōtautahi ki ngā nūpepa ā-ahiahi o Huie.

    &lt;p&gt; Ka piki rā te tāmitanga ki a Huie me te Sun i Ōtautahi, me te noho o ngā kamupene nūpepa e toru ki te whakawhiti kōrero me te whakakāhore i te huhua o ngā whakahanumitanga me ngā kōkiri hoko i runga i te kirimana ahuwhānui kāore e taea te whā nūpepa i te tāone kotahi, ā, kia hoki ki te nūpepa ā-ata kotahi me te nūpepa ā-ahiahi kotahi. Nō te marama o Nōema i te tau 1934, i hāwhengia e te Sun me te Star te utu o tā rātou utu mō te kape ki te kapa kotahi, me te whai mai a te Press i tērā huarahi, i piki ake ai ana tauanga hoko, me tana whakahoki tupu i ana hoa tauwhāinga o te ahiahi. Ka piki ngā rarunga, ka piki, ā, ka tau ngā whakaaro o ngā kaihautū o te Sun – ahakoa te hiahia o Huie kia whawhai tonu, kia hokona te pepa ki New Zealand Newspapers i ngā rā whakamutunga o Mei i te tau 1935. I ngā wiki tuatahi o Hūrae ka puta te putanga tuatahi o Christchurch Star-Sun. Ka mau tonu tēnei ingoa mō te nūpepa ā-rā taea noatia te tau 1958 ā, kua huri te ingoa hei Christchurch Star i te wā i kati ai i te tau 1991. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Mai i 1936 ki te tau 1939, i mahi a Edward Huie hei kanohi i Rānana ki Ingarangi mō The Press. I te tau 1940, i hokona e ia te Daily Mail o te Matau ā-Māui, mō tētahi kamupene tūmataiti. Ka whakahaere, ka ētita hoki ia i taua nūpepa tae rā anō ki mutunga o te pukapuka ā-rā i te marama o Hune 1941. I mate mai ia i Poihākena i te tau 1967.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Te Aroha News was the first newspaper published in Te Aroha, 
         in the Waikato. The town was relatively late in getting its own 
         newspaper, as it was well served by papers published nearby in 
         Thames.&lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt;The first issue was published by HE Whitaker, on 9 June 1883, 
         under the title Te Aroha News and Upper Thames Advocate. The paper 
         was issued weekly. In 1884 ownership passed to John Ilott and the 
         name changed to the Te Aroha and Ohinemuri News.&lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt;Over the next 40 years various other newspapers were published in 
         Te Aroha; however none posed a serious threat to the News. The paper 
         absorbed its main competitor, the Te Aroha Mail (1907-1918), in 1918.&lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt;In 1913 the Te Aroha News Company acquired the News and continued 
         to publish the paper until 1982. In July that year the company went 
         into receivership and the last issue of the paper came out on 17 
         September 1982. However, at the end of that month, a new paper with 
         the same name began publishing in Te Aroha. This newspaper merged 
         with the Piako Post in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;

At the time its only opposition was the Nelson Examiner, which the Colonist was largely established to challenge and to provide an alternative voice. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A committee of six including William Wilkie was the driving force behind the new venture, and it invited William Nation, a Sydney-based publisher with his own press, to move to Nelson to establish the newspaper. Nation and his family moved to Nelson the same year and the first issue of the Colonist was published from Wilkie’s store on 23 October 1857. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Colonist was initially published twice-weekly, and in 1882 it became a daily. In 1866 another competitor appeared, the daily Nelson Evening Mail. For a period Nelson had three newspapers; two bi-weeklies and a daily. The Examiner ceased publication in 1874, leaving the field to the Colonist and Evening Mail. The Evening Mail became Nelson’s sole newspaper when it bought out the Colonist in 1920. The final edition of the Colonist appeared on 1 May 1920. &lt;/p&gt;

    <Essay language="en">
    &lt;p&gt;The Timaru Herald is the daily newspaper in Timaru. It has been published 
      continuously since 1864. In the 1870s it was one of New Zealand’s most 
      important newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;The Herald was founded by Alfred George Horton and Ingram Shrimpton. The first 
      issue was printed on 11 June 1864. Originally publication was weekly.&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;The Herald was set up to promote the interests of Timaru and Gladstone 
      districts against those of the Canterbury province to which they belonged. 
      People in the Timaru area thought they were not getting a fair share of 
      the revenues collected by the provincial government. Horton’s 
      involvement in this issue is very clear; he helped promote a bill in 
      parliament setting up the Timaru and Gladstone Board of Works. This gave 
      Timaru more control of expenditure on public works in the area and seems 
      to have satisfied the local desire for independence from Canterbury.&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;In 1866 the Herald became a bi-weekly, and in 1871 Horton sold to Herbert 
      Belfield. Horton went on to become one of the most important newspaper 
      publishers in New Zealand when, in 1876 he joined the Wilson family to 
      create Wilson and Horton, the publishers of the New Zealand Herald for so 
      many years.&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;In the 1870s the Timaru Herald developed into a significant newspaper with a 
      national reputation. This was largely due to the editor Edward Wakefield. 
      Wakefield, the nephew of Edward Gibbon Wakefield, was an able and 
      hard-hitting writer who was active in both local and national affairs. He 
      was a Member of the House of Representatives in the 1870s and 1880s. As 
      editor of the Herald he led campaigns that gained Timaru a port and 
      waterworks. In parliament he had a reputation as a fierce debater but also 
      for fickleness, which probably prevented him from achieving high office. 
      In 1876 he was summoned to appear before the House of Representatives on a 
      charge of breach of privilege after he wrote an article in the Herald that 
      impugned the integrity of the current Members. The charges were dropped 
      after Wakefield apologised to the House. During Wakefield’s term the 
      paper began daily publication. He left the Herald in 1885 when he moved to 
      Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;During the 1880s the Herald ran into financial difficulties. The Timaru Herald 
      Company was formed to take over ownership with Herbert Belfield retained 
      as the manager of the newspaper. In 1886 the paper was leased by its 
      mortgagees to Joseph Ivess, an indefatigable founder and owner of 
      newspapers in New Zealand in the 19th century. Ivess is reckoned to have 
      started twenty-six newspapers; characteristically he did not stay with the 
      Herald for long.&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;In 1887 the paper was sold to Edward George Kerr. Kerr already owned another 
      Timaru newspaper, the South Canterbury Times. Kerr ran the Times and the 
      Herald from the same building, with the Herald published in the morning 
      and the Times in the evening. The Times was closed in 1901 as part of a 
      deal Kerr made with the other morning paper, the Timaru Post. Kerr 
      persuaded the Post to switch to evening publication, becoming in effect 
      the evening edition of the Herald. In 1923 the Herald began to subsidise 
      the Post to keep it going. The Post ceased in 1939.&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;p&gt;The Kerr family owned and managed the Herald until the 1980s when it was sold 
      to Independent Newspapers Limited (INL).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ko te Timaru Herald te nūpepa-ā-rangi ki Te Tihi-a-Maru. Kua rōnaki te tānga mai i te tau 1864. I te tekau tau mai i 1870 koia anō tētahi o ngā nūpepa hira rawa o Aotearoa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I whakaūhia te Herald e Alfred George Horton rāua ko Ingram Shrimpton. Nō te 11 o Pipiri 1864 te tānga tuatahi. Kotahi tonu te rā tānga i ia wiki i te tīmatanga.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I whakatūria te Herald hei toko atu i ngā pānga o ngā takiwā o Te Tihi-a-Maru me Gladstone ki ērā o te rohe o ngā Pākihi-whakatekateka-a-Waitaha nāna nei rāua. Pēnei ana te iwi i te takiwā o Te Tihi-a-Maru kāhore tonu i te riro i a rātou te wāhanga tōtika o ngā whiwhinga i kohikohia e te kāwanatanga porowini. Kei te mārama te whakaurutanga o Horton ki tēnei kaupapa; nāna te tautoko i tētahi pire i te Whare Pāremata e whakatū ana i te Poari o ngā Mahinga ki Te Tihi-a-Maru me Gladstone. Koia anō a Te Tihi-a-Maru i whai mana ai i ngā whakapaunga mō ngā mahi tūmatanui i tērā takiwā; koia anō i ngata ai te hiahia o te iwi kāinga kia noho wehe kē i te rohe o Waitaha. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I te tau 1866 ka rua ngā rā tānga o te Herald i ia wiki, ā, i te tau 1871 ka hokona e Horton ki a Herbert Belfield. Ka neke atu a Horton ka whanatu ko ia tētahi o ngā kaiwhakaputa nūpepa tino hira tonu o Aotearoa i tōna honotanga ki te whānau Wilson i te tau 1876, hei hanga i a Wilson and Horton, arā, te kamupene e whakaputa ana i te New Zealand Herald mō ētahi tau maha.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I te tekau tau mai i 1870 ka whanake te Timaru Herald hei nūpepa hira tonu, he rongo hoki tōna puta noa i te motu. Nā te ētita nā Edward Wakefield te tokonga ake o tēnei āhuatanga. Ko Wakefield, te irāmutu o Edward Gibbon Wakefield, ko tētahi kaituhi mātau, mārō hoki, he mātātoa ki ngā take ā-rohe, ki ngā take ā-motu hoki. He mema ia o te Whare Pāremata i waenganui i ngā tau 1870 me 1890. I a ia te ētita o te Herald, nāna tonu i ārahi ētahi whakamatāratanga i riro ai i a Te Tihi-a-Maru he poi, he pūnaha wai hoki. He kaitautohe muha tōna rongo ki te Whare Pāremata, otirā he matuarua, ā, nō konei pea te korenga nōna i eke ki te taumata. I te tau 1876 ka hāmenengia ia kia tū ki te aroaro o te Whare Pāremata i runga i te whakapae o ngā tikanga pāremata, i tana tuhinga i tētahi kōrero e uiui ana te ngākau tapatahi o ngā mema pāremata o te wā. I whakamakere ngā whakapae i te whakapāhatanga o Wakefield ki te Whare Pāremata. I tōna wā ka tīmata te tānga ā-rangi o te nūpepa. I mahue i a ia te Herald i te tau 1885 i tōna nekenga ki Pōneke.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I te tekau tau mai i 1880 ka pā ki te Herald ētahi raruraru ā-moni. Ka whakatūria te Timaru Herald Company hei taumanu i te rangatiratanga, ā, puritia ana a Herbert Belfield hei kaiwhakahaere mō te nūpepa. I te tau 1886 ka rīhingia te nūpepa e ōna kaitango mōkete ki a Joseph Ivess, he kaiwhakaū nakawhiti, he rangatira anō hoki o ētahi nūpepa ki Aotearoa i te rau tau mai i 1800. E tatauria ana nā Ivess tonu i whakatū ētahi nūpepa rua tekau mā ono; i tōna āhua tonu kāhore i roa tana noho ki te Herald. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I te tau 1887 ka hokona te nūpepa ki a Edward George Kerr. Ko Kerr tonu te rangatira o tētahi atu nūpepa i te Tihi-a-Maru, o te South Canterbury Times. I whakahaeretia e Kerr te Times me te Herald i te whare kotahi, ā, ko te Herald i tāngia i te ata, ko te Times i te ahiahi. I katia te Times i te tau 1901 he wāhi o tētahi whaihanga nāna ki tētahi atu nūpepa o te ata, arā, te Timaru Post. Whakawherea ana te Post e Kerr kia whakawhiti ki te tānga i te ahiahi, noho noa ana koia tonu te tānga ahiahi o te Herald. I te tau 1923 ka tīmata te Herald ki te tuku pūtea āwhina i te Post kia haere tonu tērā. I mutu tonu te Post i te tau 1939.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ko te whānau Kerr ngā rangatira, ko rātou tonu te whakahaere i te Herald tae atu ki te tekau tau mai i 1980, i tōna hokotanga ki te kamupene Independent Newspapers Limited (INL). &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; The Taranaki Daily News began as a weekly publication, the Taranaki News, on 14 May 1857. Its genesis was closely related to provincial politics, with one of the principal persons behind its establishment being Charles Brown, former Superintendent of the Taranaki Province. The News was set up as a rival to the Taranaki Herald, after the Herald successfully supported a rival candidate to Brown. The two newspapers remained strong rivals for over a century, although this did not prevent the News coming to the Herald’s assistance on more than one occasion when its production was affected by fire. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; During its early years the News suffered from a lack of funds; paper shortages also hampered production and on two occasions it had to print on dark blue packing paper. Frequent changes in ownership and management also hampered the development of the News and it did not really start to prosper until it was bought by Thomas List in 1905. List was a professional newspaper man, who had built up invaluable experience through his involvement with the Hutt and Petone Chronicle, the short-lived Wellington paper the Sun, and the Waimate Witness. Under List’s management, improvements to printing processes were made and branch offices were set up in Stratford and Hawera. When List took over the News he found that the newspaper was in the perilous position of having fewer than 200 regular paying subscribers. By the time of his death in 1934 circulation had expanded to such an extent that the News claimed it was the fifth largest morning newspaper in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; After the Second World War, the News took advantage of improved transport links to extend its circulation into the King Country and came to be regarded as the regional paper, while the Herald was seen as a city and provincial paper. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;  Ownership of the News and the Herald was merged in 1962 and much of their activity combined. However both papers retained their own editorial departments and competition between the old rivals continued to be keen. Eventually the Herald’s weaker circulation and advertising base, and its less favourable position as an evening paper, meant that it failed to outlast the News. &lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt; The News has had various name changes over the years, with the most recent change being in August 2004 when the title changed back from the Daily News to the Taranaki Daily News. At the same time a picture of the region’s most well-known landmark, Mount Taranaki, was added to the masthead.  &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; The Taranaki Daily News became part of the Fairfax group in 2003 and was still published as of 2014, making it the second oldest newspaper in the country after the Wanganui Chronicle.  &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; I tīmata te Taranaki Daily News hei pānui ā-wiki i mōhiotia ai ko te Taranaki News, i te 14 Mei 1857.  I takea mai i ngā mahi tōrangapū ā-rohe, nā te mea ko tētahi o ngā kaihautū matua o tōna whakatūranga ko Charles Brown, Hupiritene o mua o te Rohe o Taranaki. I whakatūria ai te News hei hoa tauwhāinga ki te Taranaki Herald, i muri i te tautoko a te Herald i tētahi kaitōrangapū tauwhāinga ki a Brown. I noho ngā niupepa e rua hei hoa tauwhāinga mō te rau tau, neke atu, ahakoa rā, i ētahi wā i tahuri te  News ki te āwhina i te Herald i te weranga o ana mīhini whakaputa pepa i te ahi.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I ngā tau tuatahi o te News ko tōna raruraru nui ko te iti o ngā pūtea whakahaere; i ētahi wā nā te kore pepa tonu i uaua ai te whakaputa i te pepa, ā, e rua ōna putanga i runga pepa takai taonga, he kikorangi uriuri te tae. Tētahi atu take i uaua ai te whanaketanga o te News ko ngā huringa o ngā kaipupuru hea me ngā kaiwhakahaere, ā, nō te hokonga o te niupepa e Thomas List i 1905 kātahi anō ka tino tupu ki tōna teitei. He kaimahi niupepa tūturu a List ā, i haria mai e ia ana tino mōhiotanga i ākona e ia i ana tau i te Hutt and Petone Chronicle, te niupepa rangitahi noa o Pōneke e mōhiotia nei ko te Sun, me te Waimate Witness. I raro i ngā whakahaere a List i piki te pai o ngā mahi o ngā tukanga tā niupepa, ā, i whakatūria he pekanga ā-rohe ki Stratford me Hawera. Nō te ekenga o List hei kaiwhakahaere mō te News i kite ia kua hē te noho o te niupepa nā te mea he iti iho i te 200 ngā kaihoko auau i te niupepa. Ka tae ki te wā o tōna matenga i te tau 1934 kua whakawhānuitia te rere o te niupepa, i āhei ai te News ki te kī koia te tuarima o ngā niupepa ā-ata i te motu katoa, mō te maha o ana kaipānui. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I muri i te Pakanga Tuarua o te Ao, ka huri te News ki te whakapiki i ana mahi i runga i tana whakamahi i ngā hononga ā-huarahi, ā-tereina ki roto i te Rohe Pōtae, nō muri ka whakaarotia koia te niupepa ā-rohe, ā, ka kīa ko te Herald he niupepa ā-tāone, ā-rohe hoki. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I whakahanumitia ngā hea o te News me te Herald i te tau 1962 me te kōtuitanga o te tini o ngā mahi a tētahi, a tētahi. Ahakoa ko tērā, i waiho motuhake tonu ngā tari tuhi kaupapa o tētahi, o tētahi, me te haere tonu o te whakataetae nui i waenga i ngā hoa tauwhāinga o tau kē. Ka taka te wā, ka heke haere te tokomaha o te hunga hoko kape, me te hunga hoko pānui o te  Herald ā, nā tōna tū ngoikore hei niupepa ā-ahiahi, i kore ai ia e ora ki tua atu i te News. &lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt; He maha ngā huringa ingoa o te News i roto i ngā tau, ā, ko tētahi o ngā huringa o ngā tau tata ko tērā i te marama o Ākuhata i te tau 2004 i huri ai tana taitara mai i te Daily News ki te  Taranaki Daily News. I taua wā anō, i tāpiritia he whakaahua o te maunga tupua o Taranaki ki te whārangi o mua o te niupepa. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; Ka uru te Taranaki Daily News hei wāhanga o te rōpū Fairfax i te tau 2003 ā, e whakaputaina tonutia ana i te tau 2014, nō reira koinei te niupepa tuarua te tawhito o ngā niupepa katoa o te motu, i muri i te Wanganui Chronicle. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Taranaki Herald was the first newspaper published in Taranaki, with 
        New Plymouth being the last of the early European settlements to get its 
        own newspaper. The paper survived a number of controversies in its early 
        years but the 1970s and 1980s were difficult times for evening newspapers 
        and the Herald ceased publication in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Herald was started by William Collins and Garland William Woon. The 
        first issue was published on 4 August 1852. In 1867 the paper was sold 
        to Henry Weston. He was the sole owner till 1920. Various members of the 
        Weston family were associated with the paper for most of its existence.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Herald, like other newspapers in New Zealand in the mid 19th century, 
        was involved in various controversies. In 1854 William Crompton, the subeditor, 
        resigned after opinions he expressed in the paper, including the denouncing 
        of marriages between Māori and Pakeha, aroused hostile criticism. In the 
        provincial elections in 1857 the Herald transferred its support from the 
        incumbent Superintendent Charles Brown to his rival George Cutfield. Cutfield 
        won the election and Brown responded by setting up the Taranaki News to 
        compete with the Herald. The editor of the Taranaki News was the former 
        editor of the Herald, Richard Pheney. Pheney had resigned over the Herald 
        withdrawing their support for Brown.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In 1875 the Herald began publishing the Budget and Taranaki Weekly Herald. 
        The Budget provided a synopsis of the news carried by the Herald each 
        week and was intended mainly for rural readers who couldn't get the paper 
        each day. The Budget lasted till 1932. In 1877 the Herald became a daily 
        newspaper; the Taranaki News had become one two years before. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Herald became the oldest newspaper in New Zealand after the Lyttleton 
        Times ceased publication in 1935. In 1962 it amalgamated with its old 
        rival, the Taranaki News (now the Daily News). The papers retained separate 
        editorial teams but shared everything else. The News was issued in the 
        morning and the Herald in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the 1970s and 1980s it became increasingly difficult to maintain evening 
        newspapers in New Zealand. The Herald was one of those affected and ceased 
        publication in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ko te Taranaki Herald te nūpepa tuatahi kia tāngia i Taranaki. Ko Nū Pāremata te whakamutunga o ngā nohanga Pākehā o aua wā ki te whiwhi i tōna nūpepa ake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nā William Collins rāua ko Garland William Woon te Herald i tīmata. Ko te putanga tuatahi i tāngia i te 4 o Ākuhata o te tau 1852. Nō te tau 1867 ka hokona ai ki a Henry Weston. Ko ia anahe te rangatira tae noa ki te tau 1920. He pānga o te maha o ngā mema o te whānau Weston ki te nūpepa mō te roanga ake o tōna wā.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He rite te Herald ki ētahi atu o ngā nūpepa o waenga o te rautau mai i 1800, i tōna urunga ki ngā tūmomo tautohetohe. Nō te tau 1854, ka tukua ai e William Crompton tōna tūnga ētita tuarua nō te kaha o te whakapae ki ana whakaaro i tuhia ki te nūpepa, pērā me tana whakahē i te moenga o te Māori ki te Pākehā. I ngā pōti porowini o te tau 1857 ka nukuhia te tautoko a te Herald mai i te Kaiwhakahaere o te wā, Charles Brown, ki tōna tāwhainga ki a George Cutfield. Ka riro i a Cutfield te pōti, ko te whakaūtunga i te Taranaki News hei tāwhainga i te Herald te whakautu a Brown. Ko te ētita o te Taranaki News te ētita o mua o te Herald, Richard Pheney. Ko te take i puta atu ai a Pheney i te Herald, nō te katinga o te tautoko i a Brown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nō te tau 1875 ka tīmata ai te Herald ki te tā i te Budget and Taranaki Weekly Herald. Ko tā te Budget he whakarato i tētahi whakarāpopotonga ia wiki i ngā kōrero i kawea e te Herald, ā, ko ōna kaipānui ngā mea noho matara e kore ai e taea te nūpepa ia rā. Ka tāngia ai te Budget tae noa ki te tau 1932. Nō te tau 1877 ka puta ai te Herald ia rā, nō ngā tau e rua o mua i pērātia ai te Taranaki News.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nō te katinga o te Lyttelton Times i te tau 1935, ko te Herald te nūpepa kaumātua o te motu. Nō te tau 1962 ka honoa ai ki tōna tāwhainga tūroa te Taranaki News (ko te Daily News ki tēnei wā). He mahitahi i te katoa o ngā rauemi engari he tīma motuhake o ia nūpepa mō te mahi ētita. Puta atu ai te News ia ata, te Herald ia ahiahi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ngā tau mai i 1970 ki te 1990, ka kaha atu te uaua o te whakaputa nūpepa ahiahi i Aotearoa. Ko te Herald tētahi i pērātia, ka katia ai i te tau 1989.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Following the first major discovery of gold in the Thames area in August 1867, William Wilkinson and Claude Corlett decided to try their luck as newspaper proprietors in the embryonic Thames settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Born in Derbyshire, England, Wilkinson arrived in Auckland on the Nimroud in 1863. He joined the Southern Cross newspaper, acting as a ‘war correspondent’ during the New Zealand Wars, notably at the battle of Gate Pa, Tauranga, in late April 1864. Corlett, from Manchester in England, a compositor by training, also worked at the Southern Cross. The first issue of the tri-weekly Thames Advertiser and Miners’ News appeared in April 1868. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; With the large influx of miners anxious for the latest goldfields news and gossip, the tri-weekly was an immediate success. Within the first year it became a daily and was the major newspaper in the Thames district during the main gold rush era. The bonanza years for the region were from 1868-1871, with impressive gold yields recorded. Gold production topped one million pounds sterling at its peak. The population of Thames built rapidly to 18,000 and it was, at the time, one of the largest towns in New Zealand. Commercial activity mushroomed and there were over 100 hotels vying for business.   The Thames Advertiser thrived in terms of circulation, and advertising was particularly buoyant with hundreds of new businesses needing to promote their presence. There was also a similarly high demand for job printing. As in other gold-mining towns there was a demand for printing ‘scrip’ for mining companies. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Corlett withdrew from the partnership after a couple of years, briefly running a competing, short-lived daily, the Thames Guardian and Mining Record (1871-1872), before spending many years as manager of the Christchurch Press.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In 1872, Wilkinson was joined by Alfred Horton who had previously begun the Timaru Herald.  Horton, who was to become the principal owner of Auckland’s New Zealand Herald, was a very experienced newspaper man and evidence of this was soon seen in the Thames Advertiser. However, Horton moved to Auckland in 1876 following a clash of editorial views. There was a succession of owners after Wilkinson sold the newspaper in the mid-1880s. William McCullough, who was associated with the rival newspaper, the Thames Evening Star (formerly Evening Mail) , purchased the Thames Advertiser in 1912 – and absorbed it into the Evening Star which, in due course, became the Thames Star. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Nō muri i te kitenga matua tuatahi o te koura ki te rohe o Hauraki i te marama o Ākuhata 1867, ka tahuri a William Wilkinson rāua ko Claude Corlett ki te whai i te mahi whakaputa niupepa i te tāone tino hou o Thames. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I whānau mai  a Wilkinson i Derbyshire, i Ingarangi, ā, ka tae mai ki Tāmaki-makau-rau i te kaipuke Nimroud i te tau 1863. Ka uru ki te niupepa o te Southern Cross hei kaikawe kōrero, ā, ko tōna tūranga rongonui pea hei ‘kaikawe kōrero mō te pakanga’ i te pakanga o Pukehinahina (Gate Pā), i Tauranga, i te mutunga o te marama o Āperira 1864. Nō Manchester, i Ingarangi a Corlett, kua whakangungua ia ki ngā mahi whakarārangi tā, ā, i mahi hoki ia i te Southern Cross. I puta te rerenga tuatahi o te niupepa toru-rā-i-te-wiki, o te Thames Advertiser and Miners’ News i te marama o Āperira 1868. Nā te nui o ngā kaikeri koura e tatari ana ki ngā rongo kōrero me ngā pakipaki o te wā, ka tino horapa tōna ingoa pai. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Heoi anō, i roto i taua tau tuatahi ka eke te niupepa hei niupepa ā-rā, ā, koia hoki te niupepa matua tuatahi o te takiwā o Hauraki i te wā o te rerenga ki te keri koura. Ko ngā tino tau mō te hua o te moni i aua wā mō te rohe, ko ngā tau mai i te 1868-1871, me te tiketike o ngā keringa koura. Ka piki te hua o te keri koura ki te kotahi miriona pauna tāringi, i tōna teiteinga rawatanga. Hohoro tonu te pikinga te tokomaha o te hunga noho i Thames ki te 18,000, ā, koia hoki tētahi o ngā tāone rahi rawa o Aotearoa mō tētahi wā. Ka tino piki ngā mahi arumoni, ā, neke atu i te 100 ngā hōtēra i te whakataetae i te tāone. Ka tino nui haere te Thames Advertiser, te taha tohanga rā, ā, ka tino kake tana umanga hoko whakatairanga ki te hia rau o ngā umanga hou kua tae mai, me te hiahia kia pānuitia ā rātou ratonga. Waihoki te mahi tā pukapuka. Rite tonu ki ērā atu tāone keri koura, inā noa ake te karanga mō ngā ratonga tā’scrip’ mō ngā kamupene keri koura. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ka kōunu a Corlett i te tokorua mō ētahi tau ruarua noa, ā, ka huri ki te whakahaere i tētahi niupepa ā-rā whakataetae, te Thames Guardian and Mining Record (1871-1872), kātahi ka haere hei kaiwhakahaere mō Christchurch Press mō ngā tau maha.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;  Nō te tau 1872, ka tae mai a Alfred Horton ki te mahi tahi ki a Wilkinson, ko Horton hoki te kaitīmata i te Timaru Herald. He tino kaiwhakahaere niupepa tautōhito a Horton, ā, ka kitea wawetia tōna tohungatanga i roto i te whanaketanga o te Thames Advertiser. Nāwai, ā, ka eke a Horton hei rangatira matua mō te  New Zealand Herald o Tāmaki-makau-rau. Ahakoa rā, ka nuku a Horton ki Tamaki-makau-rau i te tau 1876 i muri i te taupatupatunga whakaaro o ngā etita. Tērā anō te huri o ngā rangatira i muri i te hoko a Wilkinson i te niupepa i te ngahuru tau mai i 1880. Nā William McCullough, he tangata piri ki te niupepa tauwhāinga te Thames Evening Star (te Evening Mail i mua), i hoko te  Thames Advertiser i te tau 1912 – ka whakahanumitia e ia ki roto i te Evening Star, ka noho i roto i te wā hei Thames Star. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; The first major gold discovery in the Thames area took place in 1867. In the same year William Shaw arrived in Thames and started up the Times and Thames Miners’ Advocate along with Jeremiah Harnett. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Amongst other newspapers, Shaw also started the Thames Evening Star in 1869 (it first appeared as the Evening Mail). By this stage, there were 18,000 inhabitants in the town. After his bankruptcy it was taken over by James Hopcraft (editor until his death in 1879) and William McCullough, amongst others. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; One innovation of the time was the use of messages sent by pigeon to deliver news reports, known as ‘pigeongrams’. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In 1893 the daily paper became known as the Thames Star.   &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Rival paper the Thames Advertiser was purchased by McCullough and incorporated into the Star in 1912. Further changes of ownership followed. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Thames Star merged with the Paeroa Gazette in 1998 to become the Thames Valley Gazette, but the new publication lasted less than a year.   &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; I te taha o ētahi atu nūpepa, nā Shaw i tīmata te Thames Evening Star i te tau 1869 (ko tōna putanga tuatahi i raro i te ingoa o te Evening Mail). Nō te taenga mai ki tēnei wā, 18,000 ngā tāngata noho i te tāone. I muri i tōna pēkeraputanga, ka hokona e  James Hopcraft (koia hoki te ētita taea noatia tōna matenga i te tau 1879) rātou ko William McCullough, ko ētahi atu.  &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Nō te tau 1893 ka tapā te nūpepa ki te ingoa o te Thames Star.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I hokona mai te pepa tauwhāinga a te Thames Advertiser e McCullough,  ā, ka haumitia ki roto i te Star i te tau 1912. Arā atu hoki ngā tāngata nāna i hoko te nūpepa i muri mai. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ka haumitia te Thames Star ki roto i te Paeroa Gazette i te tau 1998, ka hurihia te ingoa ki te Thames Valley Gazette, engari kāore i eke ki te tau te oranga o te nūpepa hou.  &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Observer was one of a number of illustrated weekly newspapers that were popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Observer was probably not as popular or as well known as some of the other weeklies, e.g. the Weekly News, New Zealand Free Lance and the Otago Witness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Observer was first published in Auckland in 1880 by Alfred Stewart Rathbone, an English journalist who had been running the Bay of Plenty Times. The Observer's history is convoluted and closely interwoven with that of other Auckland newspapers of the 1870s and 1880s, particularly the Auckland Star.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Auckland Star started publishing in 1870. It was a liberal paper and set out to challenge the more conservative Evening News. One of the Star's owners, Henry Brett, was an important figure in the development of the press in New Zealand. He had worked for the Southern Cross and the New Zealand Herald as well as publishing a number of popular and influential periodicals besides the Star. He was also a director and chairman of the Press Association and an original member of the Newspaper Proprietors Association.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Star was popular and successful from its inception, despite having a number of rivals in the 1870s and 1880s. In addition to the Observer these also included the Free Lance, set up by John Dickson Wickham in 1879.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1884 the Observer's publishers put out the Evening Telephone to compete with the Star. However this paper soon proved a financial drain and in 1885 John Wickham acquired both the Telephone and the Observer merging them with the Free Lance and retaining the Observer name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the demise of the Telephone came the Evening Bell (first published on 12 May 1885), which lasted three years before Brett bought it and the Observer. Having incorporated the Bell, Brett sold the Observer in 1889.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 1890s the paper was called the New Zealand Observer and Free Lance. It became well established in the 1890s and similar publications were started in Christchurch (the Spectator) and Wellington (the New Zealand Free Lance).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like the other pictorial weeklies, the paper went into decline in the first half of the 20th century and stopped publishing in November 1954.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ko te New Zealand Observer tētahi o ngā nūpepa ā-wiki whai whakaahua, i paingia i te rau tau 1800-1899 me te tīmatatanga o te rau tau 1900-1999. Kāore rā pea i ōrite te paingia, te rongonui rānei ki ō ētahi atu nūpepa ā-wiki pērā me te Weekly News, New Zealand Free Lance, me te Otago Witness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I whakaputaina tuatahitia i ākarana i te tau 1880 e Alfred Stewart Rathbone, he kairīpoata Pākehā nāna te Bay of Plenty Times i whakahaere. He tino whīwhiwhi te hītori o te Observer, ā, he whakakapiti ki ētahi atu o ngā nūpepa o ngā tau mai i 1870 ki 1890 i ākarana, ērangi rawa ia ki te Auckland Star.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tīmata te puta a te Auckland Star i te tau 1870. He nūpepa whakaaro atawhai, ko tāna, he whakataetae i te whakaaro whakatūpato ake o te Evening News. Ko tētahi o ōna kaiwhaipānga, a Henry Brett, tētahi tangata nui i te whakawhanaketanga o ngā nūpepa i Aotearoa. He kaimahi ia i mua mā te Southern Cross me te New Zealand Herald, he kaiwhakaputa i ētahi nūpepa-hautaka whaimana i tua o te Star. He kaiwhakahaere, he tiamana hoki ia nō te rōpū pārongo e kīia ana te New Zealand Press Association, he kaiwhakaū anō hoki nō te rōpū o ngā rangatira o ngā nūpepa (Newspaper Proprietors Association).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I paingia, i whaihua te Star mai i tana putanga mai, ahakoa ngā nūpepa whakataetae i ngā tau mai i 1870 ki 1890. Hāunga te Observer, kei reira te Free Lance nā John Dickson Wickham i whakatū i te tau 1879.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nō te tau 1884 ka whakaputaina ai te Evening Telephone e ngā kaiwhakaputa o te Observer hei nūpepa whakataetae i te Star. Heoi anō kāore i roa ka kitea te mimiti o te pūtea, ā, i te tau 1885 ka riro i a John Wickham te Telephone me te Observer, ka tūhonotia ki te Free Lance, mau tonungia ana te ingoa Observer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nō te ngaromanga o te Telephone, ka puta ko te Evening Bell (i whakaputaina tuatahitia i te 12 o Haratua i te tau 1885), ka toru ōna tau ka hokona tahitia me te Observer e Brett. Nō te tūhonotanga o te Bell ka hokona e Brett te Observer i te tau 1889.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I te tekau tau mai i 1890 ka whakaingoatia te nūpepa ko te New Zealand Observer and Free Lance. Ka mau pai i te tekau tau mai i 1890, ā, ka tīmata ētahi atu nūpepa i ōtautahi (Spectator) me Pōneke (New Zealand Free Lance).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pērā ki ētahi atu nūpepa ā-wiki whai whakaahua, ka kore haere te pepa i te hāwhe tuatahi o te rau tau 1900-1999, ā, ka mutu te whakaputaina i te marama o Whiringa-ā-rangi i te tau 1954.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The first Europeans began to settle the Te Puke Block in 1879. Flax milling started up in the area in the 1870s and was a major industry until the early 1940s. Saw milling began in 1905 and has remained a major industry. After the swamps in the area were drained the land was found to be very suitable for crops, and maize and wheat were grown extensively. Pastoral farming was less successful until the use of cobalt, in the 1930s, cured animals’ ‘bush sickness’. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first issue of the Te Puke Times was published on February 6 1912. A week later Wellington’s Evening Post reported that ‘the first issue of the Te Puke Times is to hand, and is a creditable production’. The paper was owned and edited by Thomas H Wilsone, born in Masterton and a journalist on the Wairarapa Star before a period farming with a brother. He moved north to become part owner and editor of the Waikato Independent in Cambridge in 1910. A year later the paper was sold to the Waikato Publishing Co and Wilsone relocated his newspaper ambitions to Te Puke. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In the first issue of the Te Puke Times, Wilsone wrote: ‘We have been encouraged to take this step recognising the manifold signs of future progress which are everywhere apparent .... We hold that a well conducted journal must always exercise a certain influence for good in a community, not only in a material but in a moral sense, that its duty is not only to expose abuses but to give every encouragement to all projects initiated for the elevation of the social life of a community.’ &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The one penny paper appeared twice weekly and lived up to its promise, in common with many small-town publications of the time, of providing local news in great detail. There were lengthy articles about weddings, debutante balls and farewells, with detailed descriptions of gifts given and dresses worn. Overseas trips by local identities were given extensive coverage; visitors to the area were interviewed. There was extensive coverage of sporting events, A &amp; P Shows and, in later years,  the activities of the Women’s Institute and Women’s Division.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thomas Wilsone continued as proprietor and editor until his death in 1936, when his wife, Edith Wilsone, promoted Frederick Gemming, employed since 1919, to run the paper. Gemming leased the paper in 1939 until 1941. After ill health forced his retirement, Edith Wilsone took control for less than a year before selling the Te Puke Times to Philip Basham. &lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt; Basham served a six year printing apprenticeship at the Waikato Independent in Cambridge before joining the Hot Lakes Chronicle in Rotorua. Later, he moved to Auckland, where he ran an Otahuhu weekly, and then in 1934, to Taranaki, becoming managing director of the bi-weekly Inglewood Times. Newsprint shortages were common during the Second World War and, when a critical paper delivery by train failed to arrive, the 27 November 1942 edition of the Te Puke Times was a single 17cm x 6cm sheet – possibly the country’s smallest ever newspaper – to inform readers of an important farewell function the next night.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; After Philip Basham died in 1963 his son David continued to run the paper. In 1978 Basham and two colleagues purchased the Bay Sun, with a free Tauranga area circulation, incorporating it with the Te Puke Times. The Tuesday edition of the combined paper included Te Puke news, but this satisfied neither readers or advertisers and, in 1982, the Te Puke Times masthead and full local content were restored. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In 1983 the company was sold to John Wood and, in 1985, to NZ News Ltd. In 1989, Independent News Ltd (INL) bought part of NZ News, including the Te Puke Times and a number of other community newspapers. In 2002 Wilson and Horton, now APN NZ Ltd, purchased the paper from Independent Community Newspapers (INL). The free weekly is now published by the Bay of Plenty Times and is one of the APN News &amp; Media stable of community newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;     I tīmata te noho mai o te iwi Pākehā ki te poraka o Te Puke i te tau 1879. Ka tīmata te mahi tapahi harakeke i tēnei rohe i te ngahuru tau mai i 1870, ā, ka noho tērā hei ahumahi tino nui taea noatia mai te ngahuru tau mai i 1940.I tīmata te kani rākau i te tau 1905, ka noho hoki hei ahumahi tino nui tae mai ki nāianei. Nō muri i te whakamaroketanga o ngā repo o te rohe ka kitea he rawe te whenua mō ngā tupu, mō te kānga me te witi, ā, he kaha tonu te whakatupu i ēnei.  Kāore i pērā rawa te pai o te whāngai kau, hipi, kia tīmata ra anō te whakamahi i te konukurahina (cobalt), i ora ake ai ngā kararehe i te ‘mate ngahere’ arā, te ‘bush sickness’, i te ngahuru tau mai i 1930. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I whānau mai te putanga tuatahi o te Te Puke Times i te 6 Pēpuere 1912. Kotahi wiki i muri mai ka puta ngā kupu whakamihi a te Evening Post o Pōneke, kua ‘puta mai ki te ao, ki nga ringaringa o te tangata te rerenga tuatahi o te Te Puke Times, ā, he niupepa whai take’. Ko tēnei niupepa he pepa nā Thomas H Wilsone, he tangata i whānau mai i Māhitaone, he kaituhi hoki i te Wairarapa Star i mua i tana haere ki te pāmu whenua me tana teina. Ka nuku whaka-te-raki ia kia eke hei kaipupuri i tētahi wāhi o te Waikato Independent hei etita hoki, i Kēmureti i te tau 1910. Kotahi tau i muri mai ka hokona te niupepa ki te Waikato Publishing Co ā, ka whakahokia e Wilsone ana moemoeā mō tētahi niupepa ki Te Puke.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;     I te rerenga tuatahi o te Te Puke Times ka tuhi a Wilsone: “I hīkaka ai mātou ki te whakatutuki i tēnei moemoeā i runga i tā mātou titiro ki te ahunga whakamua o te ao he mārama ki te titiro a te kanohi, i ngā wāhi katoa.... E mea ana mātou ko tēnei mea te niupepa whai take me kawe ngā whakaaro ki te pai, i tōna takiwā, kaua ki te pai kikokiko anake, engari ki te pai wairua, otirā ko te pīkauranga nui o tēnei mea te niupepa kia kaua e mutu noa i te hura i ngā mahi hē anake, engari kia hāpainga ngā kaupapa katoa e whāia ana hei whakapiki i te pai o te noho o te katoa.” &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; E rua ngā putanga o tēnei niupepa kotahi kapa ia wiki, ā, i tutuki katoa ngā tūmanako, rite tonu ki te nuinga noa iho o ngā niupepa tāone iti o taua wā, i horaina ai te tini o ngā pitopito kōrero ā-rohe, me te pai o ngā tuhinga.  He roa tonu ngā tuhinga mō ngā mārena, mō ngā pō kanikani nui, mō ngā whakaputanga puhi o te rohe, ngā poroporoaki, me ngā whakamārama roa tonu o ngā perehana i takoto, me ngā panekoti i mauria. He roa tonu ngā pūrongo whakamārama mō ngā haerenga ki tāwāhi a ngā tāngata o te rohe; he hōhonu tonu anō hoki ngā uiuinga ki ngā manuhiri ki te takiwā.  He maha ngā pūrongo mō ngā taumāhekeheke, mā ngā Whakakitenga A &amp; P, ā, i ngā tau o muri, ngā mahi a te Women’s Institute me te Women’s Division. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;     I noho tonu a Thomas Wilsone hei rangatira, hei etita hoki taea noatia tōna matenga i te tau 1936, i reira ka whakapikia a Frederick Gemming, e te pouaru e Edith Wilsone hei kaiwhakahaere mō te niupepa. He kaimahi ia mai o te tau 1919. Ka rīhitia te pepa e Gemming i te tau 1939 tae noa ki te tau 1941. Ka pāngia e te mate, ka tukua e ia tana tūranga, ā, ka whakahaeretia e Edith Wilsone mō te wā, kāore i eke ki te tau, kātahi ka hokona te Te Puke Times ki a Philip Basham. &lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt; I noho a Basham hei pia mō ngā mahi tā pukapuka mō te ono tau i te Waikato Independent i Kēmureti i mua i tana hononga ki te Hot Lakes Chronicle i Rotorua, mahi ai. Nō muri mai ka nuku ki Tāmaki-makau-rau, i whakahaeretia e ia tētahi wīkiri ki Ōtāhuhu, ā, i te tau 1934, ka nuku ki Taranaki, ka noho hei kaiwhakahaere matua mō te Inglewood Times, e rua ōna putanga i te wiki. He maha ngā korekorenga pepa niupepa i te wā o Te Pakanga Tuarua o Te Ao, ā, i te korenga o te tino tereina me ngā pūkei pepa hei tānga e tae mai, he hīti kotahi noa te putanga o te 27 o ngā rā o Nōema 1942 o te Te Puke Times, e 17cm x 6cm te rahi. Koinei pea te niupepa iti rawa kia puta i Aotearoa, - hei whakamōhio i ngā kaipānui mō tētahi poroporoaki nui ka tū i te aonga ake. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I muri i te matenga o Philip Basham i te tau 1963 nā tana tama nā David i kawe whakamua te niupepa. Nō te tau 1978 nā Basham me ētahi o ana hoa tokorua i hoko te Bay Sun, he tohanga noa tōna ki te takiwā o Tauranga, ā, ka whakahanumitia ki te Te Puke Times. I roto i te putanga o ia Tūrei ngā pitopito kōrero o Te Puke, engari kāore ngā kaipānui me ngā kaituku pānui i rata ki tēnei āhua, ā, nō te tau 1982 ka whakarewaina anō te ingoa me ngā kai katoa o te rohe o te Te Puke Times. &lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt; Nō te tau 1983 ka hokona te kamupene ki a John Wood ā, i te tau 1985, ki NZ News Ltd. I te tau 1989, nā Independent News Ltd (INL) i hoko tētahi wāhi o NZ News, tae atu ki te Te Puke Times me ētahi atu niupepa ā-rohe. Nō te tau 2002 nā Wilson and Horton, e mōhiotia nei ko APN NZ Ltd ināianei, i hoko te niupepa mai i Independent Community Newspapers (INL). He mea whakaputa te wikiri hoatu noa e te Bay of Plenty Times koia hoki tētahi o te kāhui niupepa ā-rohe a APN News &amp; Media. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Star began publication as the evening edition of the Lyttelton Times 
        on 14 May 1868.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Star established itself as a reliable but unremarkable newspaper. 
        Probably the most noteworthy thing the Star did in its early years was 
        to bring out a Saturday night sports edition which immediately became 
        popular. Things livened up for the Star in 1914 with the publication of 
        a rival evening paper, the Sun. The Sun was a new type of newspaper in 
        New Zealand. Modelled on the London Daily Mail it had a bright layout, 
        heavy use of illustrations and an independent attitude. It was immediately 
        popular with the public. Christchurch was now overburdened with newspapers 
        - there were three evening, two morning and two weekly newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The first casualty was the Evening News which ceased in 1917. The depression 
        brought further need for rationalisation and competition intensified. 
        In November 1934 the Star dropped its price from 2d to 1d. The other dailies 
        in Christchurch soon followed. As a result there was demand for Christchurch 
        papers outside Canterbury and eventually most South Island papers reduced 
        their price. The price cutting proved unsustainable and, in June 1935, 
        the Christchurch morning papers agreed to raise the price back to 2d. 
        However the struggle continued between the Sun and the Star. The conflict 
        was settled with help from the Newspaper Proprieters Association. New 
        Zealand Newspapers Ltd, the owners of the Star and the Lyttelton Times 
        (now called the Christchurch Times), purchased the Sun and agreed to cease 
        publication of the Times. The Press Co. purchased the goodwill of the 
        Times. In June 1935 the Sun was incorporated into the Star and became 
        a new newspaper called the Christchurch Star-Sun. In the same month the 
        Christchurch Times ceased, leaving Christchurch with one morning paper, 
        the Press and one evening paper, the Star-Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Star-Sun changed title several times and was called the Christchurch 
        Star when it ceased daily publication in 1991. The Star continues to be 
        published as a bi-weekly community newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ko te tīmatanga o te Star hei putanga ahiahi o te Lyttelton Times kē nō te 14 o Mei o te tau 1868. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ka tū te Star hei nūpepa pono, he ahakoa tana kore hautupua. Tērā pea ko te mea rongonui o ōna tau tuatahi te tānga i tētahi wāhanga hākinakina, i tōna putanga mai tonu, i pai wawe ki te iwi. Nō te tau 1914, nō te putanga o te tāwhainga pepa ahiahi te Sun ka whakaohongia ake ai te Star. Ko te Sun he tūmomo nūpepa hou ki Niu Tīreni. Ko tōna tauira ko te London Daily Mail, he whakatakotoranga kānapanapa, kikī ana i te whakaahua, me te waiaro wehe kē. He tere pai ki te iwi whānui i tana putanga. Ka maha rawa ngā nūpepa o Ōtautahi i taua wā - e toru mō te ahiahi, e rua mō te ata, e rua ia wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ko te aituā tuatahi ko te Evening News i mutu i te tau 1917. He pūtake whakawhāiti mai i te pōuritanga, ā, ka kaha ake te tāwhainga. Nō te marama o Noema o te tau 1934 ka whakahekea te utu o te Star mai i 2d ki te 1d. Kātahi ka whāia e ērā o ngā nūpepa ia rā o Ōtautahi. Te mutunga iho he hiahia i waho o Ngā Pākihi-whakatekateka-a-Waitaha (Canterbury) ki ngā nūpepa o Ōtautahi, kātahi ka iti ake te utu o te nuinga o ngā nūpepa o Te Waipounamu. Kāore i taea te mauroa i te itinga iho o te utu, ā, nō te marama o Hune o te tau 1935, ka whakaaea e ngā nūpepa ata o Ōtautahi te whakahoki i te utu ki te 2d. Heoi anō, ka haere tonu te tāwhainga i waenga i te Sun me te Star. I tau te puehu i te āwhina mai a te Rōpū o ngā Rangatira Nūpepa (Newspaper Proprietors' Association). Nā New Zealand Newspapers Ltd, ngā rangatira o te Star me te Lyttelton Times (ko te Christchurch Times tōna ingoa hou), te Sun i hoko, ā, ka whakaaea te katinga o te Times. Nā te Press Co. te kaingākaunui o te Times i hoko. Nō te marama o Hune o te tau 1935 ka whakakotahitia te Sun me te Star hei nūpepa hou, te Christchurch Star-Sun. Nō taua marama anō, ka katia ai te Christchurch Times ka noho kia kotahi noa te nūpepa ata o Ōtautahi, te Press, me tētahi mea ahiahi, te Star-Sun. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He maha ngā ingoa o te Star-Sun, ā, koia te Christchurch Star i tōna mutunga hei nūpepa ia-rā i te tau 1991. Kei te haere tonu te Star hei nūpepa hapori e rua tānga ki te wiki.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Description language="en">The Tuapeka Times expired quietly in November 1941. The only hint that it was about to cease publication was an editorial in the last issue exhorting the public to support local newspapers in general. The paper probably succumbed to shortages of paper and labour due to the War and the death, three years before, of its long-serving manager, John Norrie. In this the Times wasn’t alone: many other country newspapers in New Zealand shut up shop at this time for want of resources. It is likely that the paper had struggled for years to remain open. It had only published bi-weekly since 1873 and with usually no more than four pages to an issue.</Description>
    <Description language="mi">I mate puku atu te Tuapeka Times i a Whiringa-ā-rangi o te tau 1941. Ko tētahi kupu whakapuaki i roto i te tānga whakamutunga, e aki ana i te iwi whānui kia tautokona whānuitia ngā nūpepa kāinga o te motu, koia anake te tohu iti e mutu ai ana mahi tā. I hemo tonu pea te nūpepa i ngā kōpaka pepa, kōpaka kaimahi hoki i puta i te Pakanga o te Ao, i te matenga anō hoki, e toru tau ki mua, o tōna kaiwhakahaere tūroa, o John Norrie. I tēnei āhuatanga kāore te Times i tū ko tōna kotahi: he maha noa atu ngā nūpepa taiwhenua o Niu Tireni i kati ai i ō rātou kūwaha i taua wā i te kōpaka rauemi. Kei te tika tonu pea i maha ngā tau i whawhai te nūpepa ki te noho puare tonu. Mai i te tau 1873 e rua noa āna tānga ia wiki, ā, te nuinga o te wā kāore i hipa ake ia tānga i te whā whārangi.  </Description>

    &lt;p&gt;In 1869 they took over their rival, the Tuapeka Press (1866-69). In 1881 the Times was bought by Thomas and Richard Pilling. They published it till 1896 when it was sold to the Tuapeka Times Company, managed by John Norrie. Norrie remained in charge of the paper until his death in 1938.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Tuapeka Times expired quietly in November 1941. The only hint that it was about to cease publication was an editorial in the last issue exhorting the public to support local newspapers in general. The paper probably succumbed to shortages of paper and labour due to the War and the death, three years before, of its long-serving manager, John Norrie. In this the Times wasn’t alone: many other country newspapers in New Zealand shut up shop at this time for want of resources. It is likely that the paper had struggled for years to remain open. It had only published bi-weekly since 1873 and with usually no more than four pages to an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The nature of the Times’ demise contrasts with its early years when the paper was at the centre of the gold boom in Central Otago. Gabriel’s Gully, the site of New Zealand’s most significant gold find, was nearby. The Times was a product of the boom and the issues from this time are an essential resource for the study of New Zealand’s history in the mid nineteenth century, when the gold from this area made Otago the leading province in the colony.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I whakaputaina te Tuapeka Times i te tāone o Lawrence, i Otākou o Waenganui mai i te tau 1868 ki te tau 1941. Nā Andrew Ferguson, rātou ko Andrew Burns, ko John Ludford te Times i tīmata.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I te tau 1869 i taumanutia e rātou tō rātou tāwhainga, te Tuapeka Press (1866-69). I te tau 1881 nā Thomas rāua ko Richard Pilling te Times i hoko. Ka whakaputaina e rāua tae noa ki te tau 1896, i hokona atu ai ki te Kamupene o te Tuapeka Times, nā John Norrie i whakahaere. Ka noho ko Norrie te rangatira o te nūpepa tae noa ki tōna matenga i te tau 1938.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mate puku atu te Tuapeka Times i a Whiringa-ā-rangi o te tau 1941. Ko tētahi kupu whakapuaki i roto i te tānga whakamutunga, e aki ana i te iwi whānui kia tautokona whānuitia ngā nūpepa kāinga o te motu, koia anake te tohu iti e mutu ai ana mahi tā. I hemo tonu pea te nūpepa i ngā kōpaka pepa, kōpaka kaimahi hoki i puta i te Pakanga o te Ao, i te matenga anō hoki, e toru tau ki mua, o tōna kaiwhakahaere tūroa, o John Norrie. I tēnei āhuatanga kāore te Times i tū ko tōna kotahi: he maha noa atu ngā nūpepa taiwhenua o Niu Tireni i kati ai i ō rātou kūwaha i taua wā i te kōpaka rauemi. Kei te tika tonu pea i maha ngā tau i whawhai te nūpepa ki te noho puare tonu. Mai i te tau 1873 e rua noa āna tānga ia wiki, ā, te nuinga o te wā kāore i hipa ake ia tānga i te whā whārangi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He rerekē te āhua o te matenga o te Times ina whakaritea ki ōna tau tīmata i noho ai te nūpepa ki waenganui tonu i te wā e tino reia ana te koura e ngā kairapu koura i Otākou o Waenganui. I pātata hoki a Gabriel’s Gully ki te wāhi i kitea ai tō Niu Tireni kitenga tino hiranga tonu o te koura. He whakaputanga te Times nō taua wā rapu koura, nā reira ka noho āna tānga o tērā wā hei rauemi tino waiwai tonu o te ako i te hītori o Niu Tireni i waenganui o te rautau tekau mā iwa, te wā i mea ai e te koura ko Otākou te porowini o mua tonu o te taiwhenua.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; The Weekly Review was the only active newspaper in Upper Hutt at the time, and was printed in Wellington. It holds a wealth of information about historical Upper Hutt, a significant contribution being letters to the editor regarding the ‘old days’, personal stories about living in Upper Hutt at the turn of the twentieth century. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; The Victoria Times was only published once but is noteworthy for several reasons; it was Wellington's second earliest paper, it was lithographed rather than letter-pressed and it contains a plan of Wellington on the back page. The plan was hand-coloured in some issues although not the one presented here. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Victoria Times was published by Thomas Bluett and Jacob Jones. They had previously produced lithographs for the New Zealand Company, including a chart of Port Nicholson that's now recognized as New Zealand's first lithograph. Given that the Company had a strong interest in Wellington’s other newspaper, the New Zealand Gazette, the decision to publish a rival paper seems reckless. And is presumably one of the reasons why the paper failed to appear again. Another possible reason for the paper’s brief life was that the partnership of Bluett and Jones did not endure. Jones announced its dissolution in the Gazette in late 1841.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Bluett moved to Tasmania. Records show him operating a lithographic firm in Hobart in 1842. Examples of his work are held in various archives in Australia. He died in England in 1846.     &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; From 1 July 1910, the Diocese of Waiapu Parish magazine was incorporated into the new Church Gazette. The cost of the new paper was raised to 3 shillings per annum, from two shillings. For this subscribers would received a much larger paper. The Rev. Canon Tuke requested that ‘…all who owe anything for last year’s magazine will promptly remit it to the Vicar, who is considerably out of pocket in his attempt to give the Parish a good Church Paper.’ In fact, only personal financial support from the Bishop of Waiapu, Alfred Averill, ensured its early survival. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Not surprisingly, there was a break in publication for several months after the 3 February 1931 earthquake. The 1 May 1931 issue begins with a letter from the Bishop, outlining the impact of the earthquake on Diocesan property, including the complete destruction of the Cathedral. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The article ‘Synod scuttles ‘Gazette’’ in the issue of 1 November 1945 announced the impending end to publication of the Waiapu Church Gazette. The Gazette was to be amalgamated with the Church and People from Wellington and the Gazette from Auckland. This decision did not meet with the agreement of the author. This was made even clearer in the following and final issue of the Waiapu Church Gazette, 1 December 1945.  Particular objection was expressed to the new focus on advertising and making a profit. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; The first Wairarapa newspapers were published in Greytown.  Joseph Payton, a school teacher, was a partner with his father-in-law Richard Wakelin in one of them, the bi-weekly Wairarapa Standard which began publication in 1872. However, when Payton decided Masterton was destined to be the largest town in the valley, he convened a meeting in the more northerly town to discuss beginning a newspaper there. There were several short-lived attempts from the end of 1874, not helped by the premises of two papers being burned to the ground. Subsequently, Joseph Payton, now in partnership with W F Roydhouse and Edward Samuel began, in November 1878, the region’s first daily, the Wairarapa Daily. It absorbed one of the town’s struggling papers.  &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; Initially, Payton was editor, sub-editor and business manager on the four-page evening paper, Roydhouse was general reporter and Samuel supplied articles on a more casual basis. Edward Samuel retired from the enterprise when he was appointed headmaster of the Carterton School in 1880, leaving Messrs Payton and Roydhouse as partners. By 1878 the railway had reached only as far as Featherston, so for the next two years William Roydhouse spent considerable time in the saddle covering events in the lower valley. The railway reached Masterton in 1880, simplifying distribution, previously by relays of horses, and the town grew as Payton had foreseen. The 1878 population of 1,673 had nearly doubled to 3,160 by 1886.     &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;  The first printing machine consisted of a large non-stop drum, with one employee feeding in the paper at the top and a boy at the back taking off the printed sheets which were then folded by hand. The power was generated by a flywheel turned by two more boys. About 1903, an Elliott printing press was installed, first driven by a gas engine and later converted to electricity.   &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; In 1892, the paper, now well-established, changed its name to the Wairarapa Daily Times. There was evening competition from the Wairarapa Star for a number of years, one of its editors being Alexander W Hogg, later MP for Masterton and a cabinet minister in 1909. Following changes in ownership, the Star was reborn as a morning daily, the Wairarapa Age, in 1902. Later editors included A H Vile and Guy H Scholefield, who became Parliamentary Librarian in 1926.  &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; Joseph Payton, who kept plant and type up-to-date, ran one of the country’s best produced provincial newspapers until his death in 1910. It also had a reputation for the quality and depth of its local coverage. A private Payton family company then ran the Wairarapa Daily Times until it merged with the Wairarapa Times-Age in 1938.  In 2002 the newspaper was bought by Wilson &amp; Horton which was subsequently acquired by APN News &amp; Media. &lt;p&gt;

Ko Joseph Payton, he kaiwhakaako kura, he hoa pakihi hoki a ia ki a Richard Wakelin tōna hungarei i tētahi o ngā niupepa, te Wairarapa Standard he mea whakaputa ia rua wiki, i tīmataria i te tau 1872. Heoi anō, i te whakataunga a Payton ka tipu a Whakaoriori (Masterton) hei taone nui o te riu, ka whakatūria e ia he hui ki taua taone rā ki te raki, ki te whakawhitiwhiti kōrero mō te tīmata i tētahi niupepa ki reira. E rua ngā whakamātautau poto noa iho mai i te mutunga o 1874, i raru anō hoki i runga i te mea ko ngā whare o ngā niupepa e rua i kainga e te ahi. I muri iho i tīmataria e Joseph Payton, e mahi ā-hoa pakihi ana i te taha o W F Roydhouse rāua ko Edward Samuel, i te Nōema o te tau 1878, te niupepa tuatahi o te rohe, arā, te Wairarapa Daily. I whakawhenumitia e ia tētahi o ngā niupepa e raru ana o te taone.  &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; I te tīmatanga ko Payton te ētita, te ētita tuarua me te kaiwhakahaere pakihi ki te pepa o te ahiahi e whā ngā whārangi, ko Roydhouse te kairīpoata whānui, ā, nā Samuel ētahi tuhi pānui i tuku poka noa nei. I te whakatūnga a Edward Samuel ki te tūranga o te tumuaki o te kura o Carterton i te tau 1880 i puta a ia i te umanga, ka waiho ko Payton rāua ko Roydhouse hei hoa pakihi ki a rāua anō. Nō te tau 1878 kua tae noa iho te rerewhenua (te tereina) ki Kaiwaewae (Featherston), nō reira mō ngā tau e rua he eke hoiho te mahi a William Roydhouse e hopu ana i ngā rongo kōrero o te riu i raro. I tae te rerewhenua ki Whakaoriori i te tau 1880, hei whakamāmā i te tuaritanga, arā, te mahi a ngā tānga hōiho i mua, ā, i tipu te taone pērā i te matapae a Payton. Nō te tau 1878 kua tata taurua te taupori mai i te 1,673 ki te 3,160 i te tau 1886.  &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; Ko te āhua o te perehi tā tuatahi he taramu kore mutunga nui, he whāngai pepa i mua te mahi a tētahi kaimahi, ko te mahi a tētahi tama i muri he tango i ngā rau kua oti te tā, kātahi ka pōkai ā-ringa aua rau. I ahu mai te kaha i tētahi wīra rere ka hurihia e ētahi tama e rua anō. I te tau āhua 1903, i whakaurua he perehi tā Elliott, nā tētahi pūkaha hau te kaha i te tuatahi, nō muri i hurihia ai ki te hiko.  &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1892 i hurihia te ingoa o te pepa, kua roa e haere ana ināianei, ki te Wairarapa Daily Times. I whakaritea tētahi whakataetae mai i te Wairarapa Star mō ētahi tau, ko tētahi o ana ētita ko Alexander W Hogg, i muri i tērā ko ia te Mema Pāremata mā Whakaoriori, he minita o te rūnanga o te kāwanatanga hoki i te tau 1909. Nō muri mai i te hokotanga mai a tētahi atu ka whānau mai anō te Star hei pepa o te ata, ā, ka tapaina ko te Wairarapa Age i te tau 1902. Ko ētahi o ngā ētita i muri atu ko A H Vile, ko Guy H Scholefield hoki, i riro i a ia te tūranga a te Kaitiaki Pukapuka Whare Pāremata i te tau 1926.   &lt;p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; Nā Joseph Payton, he tangata kaha ki te whakahou i āna rawa, i āna momotuhi hoki, nāna i whakahaere tētahi o ngā tino pepa ā-rohe o te whenua tae noa ki tōna matenga i te tau 1910. He rongonui hoki taua pepa mō te kounga me te hōhonu o āna rongo kōrero o te rohe paetata. I whakahaeretia te Wairarapa Daily Times e tētahi kamupene ā-whānau Payton tae atu ki te wā i hanumi atu ki te Wairarapa Times-Age i 1938.  I 2002 i hokona te niupepa e Wilson &amp; Horton, ā, i muri mai e APN News &amp; Media.  &lt;p&gt;

    <Essay language="en">
    &lt;p&gt;The West Coast Times owes its existence to the gold rush on the West Coast in 1865. Before the gold rush there were few European settlers on the West Coast, certainly not enough to sustain a newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The West Coast Times was the first of many papers to start up in the Hokitika area after the rush began. The Times started in May 1865, only two months after the Provincial Government in Canterbury had proclaimed the goldfield on the West Coast. The paper was founded by John Tyrrell but soon sold to William Shaw, a local politician. Shaw was Mayor of Hokitika in 1867.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That the Times prospered on the back of the gold boom can be seen by its publishing activities. In 1865 a weekly edition for rural readers called the Leader was issued, in January 1866 the Times became a daily, and later that year they published a daily evening paper, the Despatch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The boom in Hokitika and opposition to Shaw’s political activities encouraged others to set up newspapers in the town. The Times’ most serious rival was the Evening Star, founded by Joseph Klein and James Snyder Browne in 1867 mostly to oppose Shaw. The competition between these papers peaked in 1868 when Klein and Browne provided the financial backing and management for a new morning paper, the Westland Observer. Shaw responded by reviving the Despatch, his evening paper that had gone into abeyance the year before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However the situation was soon resolved when Shaw decided to leave Hokitika. Klein and Browne bought the Times from him and immediately stopped publishing the Despatch and the Observer. From then to its demise in 1917 the Times’ history was much less eventful. Ownership changed several more times. In 1874 Robert Caldwell Reid took over. Reid was a prominent politician active in both provincial and national government. In the 1880s the paper was sold to Leonard Northcroft and Harry Snow and in 1917 it was sold to Dawes, Nightingale and Co. Later that year it was absorbed into the Hokitika Guardian and Star.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Nā te rerenga ki te kōura i te Tai Poutini i te tau 1865 i ora ai te West Coast Times. I mua o te rerenga kōura he ruarua noa iho ngā tāngata whai Pākehā i te Tai Poutini, he iti rawa hei ukauka i tētahi nūpepa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ko te West Coast Times te tuatahi o ngā nūpepa maha ki te tīmata i te takiwā o Hokitika i muri o te tīmatanga o te rerenga ki te kōura. I tīmata te West Coast Times i te marama o Haratua 1865, e rua marama noa i muri o te pānuitanga o te pārae kōura i te Tai Poutini i a te Kāwanatanga Porowini i ngā Pākihi-whakatekateka-a-Waitaha. I whakaūhia te nūpepa e John Tyrell, otirā taro tonu te hokonga ki a William Shaw, he kaitōrangapū o te rohe. Ko Shaw te Mea o Hokitika i te tau 1867.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ko te angitu o te West Coast Times i takea mai i te tōnuitanga o te mahi kimi kōura, ka kitea i āna mahi pānui. I te tau 1865 ka puta tētahi tānga ā-wiki i huaina te Leader mō te hunga taiwhenua. Ka tīmata te tānga ia rā o te Times i te marama o Kohi-tātea 1866, ā, nō muri mai i taua tau anō ka perēhitia e rātou tētahi nūpepa ā-ahiahi ia rā, arā, te Despatch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nā te tōnuitanga i Hokitika me te mautohenga ki ngā mahi tōrangapū a Shaw i whakahau i ētahi atu kia whakaūhia he nūpepa i te tāone. Ko te Evening Star te tino tāwhai o te Times, nā Joseph Klein rāua ko James Snyder Browne i whakaū i te tau 1867, he mautohe ki a Shaw te tino take. I tae rawa te whakataetae i waenganui i ngā nūpepa ki tōna tihi i te tau 1868, i te whakaratonga o Klein rāua ko Browne i te pūtea tautoko, i te whakahaerenga hoki mō tētahi nūpepa ā-ata, arā, te Westland Observer. Ko te whakautu a Shaw ko te whakaoratanga i te Despatch, tana nūpepa ā-ahiahi i whakamutua i te tau i mua.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heoi i whakatau tonu tēnei āhuatanga i te whakaritenga o Shaw ki te wehe atu i Hokitika. Ka hokona i a ia te Times e Klein rāua ko Browne, ā, whakamutua wawetia ana e rāua te tānga o te Despatch me te Observer. Mai i tērā wā tae noa ki tōna mutunga i 1917 he āhua hira kore te hītori o te Times. He maha tonu ngā whakawhitinga rangatiratanga. I te tau 1874 ka taumanu a Robert Caldwell Reid. He kaitōrangapū whakarae a Reid, he mātātoa ki ngā kāwanatanga ā-rohe, ā-motu hoki. I hokona te nūpepa ki a Leonard Northcroft rāua ko Harry Snow i te tekau tau mai i 1880, ā, i te tau 1917 ka hokona ki te kamupene o Dawes, Nightingale &amp; Co. Nō muri mai i taua tau anō ka hanumi ki te Hokitika Guardian and Star.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mutu te tānga o te Hokitika Guardian i te tau 1988. &lt;/p&gt;

    <Essay language="en">
    &lt;p&gt;Wanganui was the first town in the wider Wellington region to 
       have its own newspaper, the Wanganui Record which was published 
       for a few weeks in 1853.&lt;/p&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;The Wanganui Chronicle was the next newspaper attempted in Wanganui. 
       Henry Stokes first proposed the paper in 1856 but initially publication 
       was held back by lack of equipment. The first issue was produced on 
       18 September 1856 on a makeshift press, made by staff and pupils 
       at the local industrial school. Shortly after this Stokes imported 
       a press from Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;       
       &lt;p&gt;However in the 1860s the paper had competition from the Wanganui 
       Times and the Evening Herald (later called the Wanganui Herald). 
       The Times didn't survive the decade but the Herald, under John 
       Ballance, established itself as a serious rival to the Chronicle. 
       The Chronicle responded by publishing three times a week in 1867 
       (publication frequency had been erratic up till then) and then 
       daily in 1871.&lt;/p&gt;       
       &lt;p&gt;The two papers competed against each other strongly for the next 
       100 years or more. The Chronicle tended to represent conservative 
       opinion while the Herald was more liberal. However, the rivalry 
       was often friendly. In 1888 Ballance let the Chronicle use his 
       equipment to produce their paper after the Chronicle office 
       burnt down.&lt;/p&gt;       
       &lt;p&gt;Like many 19th century New Zealand newspapers, the Chronicle 
       changed hands a number of times. One of the most noteworthy 
       owners and editors was Gilbert Carson who took over in 1875. 
       Carson was Mayor of Wanganui from 1881 to 1884 and a member 
       of the House of Representatives and the Legislative Council. 
       He proved to be an effective opponent of John Ballance and 
       the Wanganui Herald.&lt;/p&gt;       
       &lt;p&gt;In the 1970s the ownership and the editorship of the Chronicle 
       and the Herald merged and the two papers continued to come out 
       separately (the Chronicle in the morning and the Herald in the 
       evening). While it may have been intended to keep the papers distinct, 
       in reality they became like two editions of the same paper. In 1986 
       the Herald was replaced with a community newspaper of the same name 
       and the Chronicle continued on as Wanganui's daily newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ko Wanganui te tāone tuatahi o te rohe whānui o Te Upoko o te Ika i riro i te taone tana ake nūpepa. Ko taua nūpepa ko te Wanganui Record, ā, he rite tonu te puta mai mō ētahi wiki noa iho i te tau 1853.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ko te Wanganui Chronicle te nūpepa tuarua i puta mai i Wanganui I marohitia e Henry Stokes i te tau 1856. I te tīmatanga i uaua te mahi whakatā nō te mea kāhore he mīhini perehi. Ko te tānga tuatahi ka whakaputaina ki runga i tētahi mīhini perehi whakakapi i te 18 o Mahuru 1856. Nā ngā kaiako me ngā tauira o te kura hangarau pātata i hanga. I muri tata i tēnei nā, ka hokona mai e Stokes tētahi mīhini perehi mai i Poihākena (Sydney).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engari, i te tekau tau mai i 1860, ka tīmata mai te nūpepa ko te Wanganui Times me te Evening Herald (ka karangahia ā muri ake ko te Wanganui Herald). Kāhore te Wanganui Times i tū mō te tekau tau ki muri. Engari ka tino ora te Herald i raro i Te Paranihi (John Ballance), ā, ka tipu ake he tino nūpepa kaha ki te tū i te taha o te Chronicle. I tēnei nā, ka tīmata te Chronicle ki te puta mai i ngā rā e toru i ia wiki, ā, i te tau 1871 ka puta mai ia rā. Mō ngā tau ki mua i taua rā, he kōtītiti nei te āhua o te puta mai o te nūpepa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mō te rau tau i muri mai ka rite tonu te whakataetae o ngā nūpepa nei. Ko te Chronicle ka whai i ngā kaupapa whakatūpato. Ko te Herald, ka whai ake i ngā kaupapa atawhai. Ahakoa ngā taukumekume, he whakataetae ratarata nei. I te tau 1888, ka tukuna e Te Paranihi kia tāngia te Chronicle i runga ake i āna mīhini nō te mea i tahuna tā rātou tari ki te ahi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I runga i ngā āhuatanga o ngā nūpepa o Aotearoa i tērā rau tau, ka rite tonu te whakawhiti i ngā kaipupuri o te Chronicle. Ko tētahi o ngā rangatira, ētita tino rongonui ko Gilbert Carson, ā, i uru mai ia i te tau 1875. Ko ia te Mea o te tāone o Wanganui mai i te tau 1881 ki te 1884, ā, ko ia hoki he mema mo te Whare Pāremata me te Kaunihera Ture. He tino kaitohetohe ia mō Te Paranihi me te Wanganui Herald.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I te tekau tau mai i 1970 ka tūhono ngā nūpepa e rua i raro i te rōpū kaipupuri, ētita kotahi, engari ka rite tonu te puta wehe mai (ko te Chronicle i te ata, ā, ko te Herald i te ahiahi). Ko te wawata kia noho wehe ngā nūpepa e rua nei, engari koa ka puta rāua i runga i te āhuatanga he ōrite ai ngā kōrero o tētahi ki tētahi. I te tau 1986 ka uru kē mai he nūpepa hapori e mau ana i te ingoa o te Herald. Engari ko te Chronicle kei te noho tonu ko te nūpepa o ia rā anake kei Wanganui.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Waimate Advertiser started on the 28 May 1898 as a four-page 
       weekly, and was published free for the first three months. It was 
       founded by Charles Augustus and Harold Wilson, two brothers aged 
       nineteen and seventeen, who were joined a year later by their 
       younger brother George Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;After six months the paper doubled in size and was issued as a 
       weekly penny paper. By twelve months it came out three times a 
       week to match its rival, the Waimate Times. Editorially the paper 
       aimed to be politically independent and described itself as taking 
       an active interest in the social affairs of Waimate and the surrounding 
       district.&lt;/p&gt;       
       &lt;p&gt;In 1908 the paper was taken over by S H Wilson (no relation to the 
       original owners) with Robert Joseph Logan as editor. In 1914 it 
       became a daily and in 1916 it was transferred to Logan and Mrs A 
       K Sargent, who changed the name to the Waimate Daily Advertiser 
       to reflect the earlier change in publication frequency.&lt;/p&gt;       
       &lt;p&gt;In 1921 the paper was sold to the Waimate Advertiser Company, 
       although Mrs Sargent retained the majority interest. The change 
       in ownership again brought about a name change and the paper became 
       the Daily Advertiser. In 1922 the company purchased the rival 
       Waimate Times, leaving the Daily Advertiser as the town's sole 
       newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;       
       &lt;p&gt;The Waimate Publishing Company took over the business in 1939. 
       In 1972 the paper changed back to its former title of Waimate Daily 
       Advertiser, and from 1980 reverted to its original title of Waimate 
       Advertiser.  This last change coincided with a change back to being 
       published three times a week. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I tīmata te Waimate Advertiser, he whakaputanga whārangi-tokowhā i te 28 o Haratua 1898, ā, i whakaputa kore utuhia mō ngā marama e toru ki te tuatahi. I tīmatahia e Charles Augustus me tana teina a Harold Wilson, tekau mā iwa me te tekau mā whitu ō rāua pakeke, ā, i uru atu tō rāua teina a George Wilson kotahi tau i muri mai.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Muri iho i ngā marama e ono kā tāruahia ake te nui o te nūpepa nei, ā, ka whakaputahia hei nūpepa ā-wiki tahi kapa. I muri mai i te tekau mā rua marama e toru kē ōna whakaputanga ia wiki kia ōrite atu ai ki tōna nūpepa whakataetae, ki te Waimate Times.

&lt;p&gt;I te tau 1908 i riro i a S H Wilson (ēhara i te whanaunga ki ngā rangatira i tīmatahia ai) te mana whakahaere mō te nūpepa, ā, ko Robert Joseph Logan te ētita. I te tau 1914 ka huri kia puta ia rā, ā, i te tau 1916 i riro i a Logan rāua ko Mrs A K Sargent te mana whakahaere ka hurihia hoki te ingoa ki te Waimate Daily Advertiser kia hāngai ai ki te huringa o te whakaputanga o mua atu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I te tau 1921 i hokona ai te nūpepa ki te kamupene ko te Waimate Advertiser Company, ēngari i mau tonu i a Mrs Sargent te nuinga o ngā hea. Nā te huringa o te mana whakahaere i hurihia anō te ingoa ki te Daily Advertiser. I te tau 1922 i hokona e taua kamupene te nūpepa whakataetae ko te Waimate Times kia riro ai te Daily Advertiser anake te nūpepa o taua tāone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I riro i te kamupene kaiwhakaputa pukapuka, ko te Waimate Publishing Company, te pakihi nei i te tau 1939. I te tau 1972 i hoki anō te nūpepa ki tōna ingoa o mua ki te Waimate Daily Advertiser, ā, mai i te tau 1980 i hoki anō ki tōna ingoa tīmatanga ki te Waimate Advertiser.

&lt;p&gt; In keeping with the times, Westport, at the northern end of the Westland goldfields, had a colourful and often changing newspaper history. Near the mouth of the Buller River, and on its eastern bank, Westport’s early growth was principally due to the gold rush at Charlestown, 26 kms to the south.  From 1866 to the end of the decade, the population in and around Charleston ballooned to about 10,000. At the peak of this gold rush in 1867, Westport’s population was about 1,500 but growth over subsequent decades was slow and sporadic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The first Westport newspaper was quickly on the scene. John Tyrrell, who learnt the printing trade in Dublin, arrived in New Zealand via Australia and a stint with the Melbourne Chronicle, Australia’s first, if short-lived, evening paper. He started the West Coast Times in Hokitika in 1865, launched the daily Waimea Chronicle in early 1866, and then the Westport Times in December that year. He began it as the Westport Times and Buller Express in partnership with Job Munson, an American-born printer, who began in the trade as a 11-year-old. Munson sold his holding several years before becoming a shareholder in the rival Westport News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; With Charleston booming, in 1867 the paper’s plant was moved there briefly and, also temporarily, its name changed to Westport Times and Charleston Argus. The name was shortened to Westport Times in 1869. It usually appeared twice weekly but, according to the Union List of NZ Newspapers Before 1940, there may have been periods when it came out three times a week or even daily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In 1871, Irishman Eugene O’Connor, later a prominent South Island politician, briefly owned the paper before setting up the rival Westport News. Tyrrell, owner again, countered by producing the Westport Times as a daily for a period. In the early 1880s Tyrrell bought the Westport Evening Star, which had begun in 1867. In 1883, he was found guilty of libelling Charles Wright, in an ‘Open Column’ letter in the Star in relation to his conduct as borough valuer. Wright was also proprietor of the Buller News. Tyrrell was fined £50.  In 1892, when Tyrrell died, the two papers merged to become the Westport Times and Evening Star.  Later, probably in 1898, the then-daily became the Westport Times and Star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Following  John Tyrrell’s death, Thomas Patrick Williams became the managing proprietor. Born in Auckland, he joined the staff of the Westport Times as printer’s devil in 1872 and had become manager by 1885. The Cyclopedia of New Zealand (Nelson, Marlborough and Westland Provincial Districts), published in 1906, listed William Gothard as editor. An Australian, he had been apprenticed to Tyrrell in 1874, having worked in the Post Office previously and then ‘served through all branches of the newspaper and printing business’.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The newspaper continued as a daily until 1937 and a change of ownership and name. A new private company in Hokitika, with a capital of £300 in £1 shares, took over the Westport Times and Star and called it the Buller Times. It ceased publication on November 1, 1941. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; E whai ana i te ia o te wā, i Westport, i te pito whakateraki o ngā papa koura o Westland, he whakamere, he nui hoki ngā piki me ngā heke o tōna hītori niupepa. Tata ki te wahapū o te Awa Buller, kei tōna ākau whakaterāwhiti, i tīmata ai te tupu o Westport i runga i ngā mahi rerenga koura i Charlestown, 26 km ki te Tonga.  Mai i 1866 ki te mutunga o taua tekau tau i tere piki te taupori i Charleston, huri noa hoki ki te āhua 10,000 ngā tāngata.  I te taumata o tēnei rerenga koura i 1867 , he āhua 1,500 te taupori o Westport, engari he pōturi, he pokapoka hoki te pikinga i ngā tekau tau whai muri mai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Kāore i roa i puta mai te niupepa tuatahi o Westport.  I ako a John Tyrrell i ngā mahi tā i ako i Dublin, ā, ka tae mai ki Aotearoa mā Ahitereiria, i tētahi mahi poto i te Melbourne Chronicle, te pepa ahiahi tuatahi o Ahitereiria mō te wā poto noa iho.  Ka whakarewa ia i te West Coast Times i Hokitika i 1865, nāna hoki te Waimea Chronicle i whakatere i te tīmatanga o 1866, me te Westport Times i Hakihea i taua tau. Ko te Westport Times and Buller Express tōna ingoa i te tuatahi, ā, he mea tīmata i te taha o Job Munson, he kaitā i whānau mai i Amerika, i tīmata hoki ana mahi i a ia ka 11 noa iho ōna tau. I hokona atu e Munson ana hea ētahi tau i mua i tana hokonga mai i ngā hea o te niupepa tāwhai te Westport News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Nā te nui o ngā mahi e tīmata ana i Charleston, i nuku te wheketere o te niupepa ki reira i te tau 1867, i huri hoki tōna ingoa mō te wā poto ki te Westport Times me te Charleston Argus. I whakarāpopotongia tōna ingoa ki te Westport Times i 1869.  E rua ana putanga ia wiki engari e ai ki te Union List of NZ Newspapers before 1940, he wā tōna pea i whakaputaina e toru ngā wā ia wiki, ia rā rānei. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I 1871 i hokona e tētahi Airihi, a Eugene O'Conner, he kaitōrangapū rongonui ki te Waipounamu, te niupepa i mua te tana whakatū i te Westport Times hei niupepa tāwhai. I ātetetia ai e Tyrrell, mā te whakaputanga mō tētahi wā o te Westport Times hei putanga ā-rā. I te tīmatatanga o ngā tau 1880 i hokona e Tyrrell te Westport Evening Star, he mea i tīmata i te tau 1867.  I 1883 i mau tangetange a ia mō te kupu whakakino i a Charles Wright i tētahi reta ‘Tīwae Tuwhera’ i te Star e pā ana ki ana whanonga hei kaiwhakatauuara mō te tāone. Ko Wright hoki te kaipupuri o te Buller News. I whuia a Tyrrell ki te £50.  I 1892, i te matenga o Tyrrell, i hanumi ngā niupepa e rua, i hurihia te ingoa ki Westport Times and Evening Star.  Nō muri mai, i te āhua 1898, i hurihia te ingoa ki te Westport Times and Star.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I muri i te matenga o John Tyrrell, ka riro i a Thomas Patrick Williams te tūranga a te kaiwhakahaere matua. I whānau mai a ia i Tāmaki makaurau, nō te tau 1872 i tīmata a ia ki te Westport Times hei pia kaitā, ā, nō te tau 1885 ka riro i a ia te tūranga a te kaiwhakahaere. I kīia i te Cyclopedia of New Zealand (Nelson, Marlborough and Westland Provincial Districts), he mea whakaputa i te tau 1906, ko William Gothard te ētita. Nō Ahitereiria ia, he pia ia ki a Tyrrell i 1874, he kaimahi i te Post Office i mua, katahi ka ‘mahi ia i ngā wāhanga katoa o te pakihi niupepa me te tā hoki'. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I haere tonu te mahi a te niupepa tae noa mai ki te tau 1937, i hokona, i hurihia hoki te ingoa. Ka riro i tētahi kamupene tūmataiti, hou hoki i Hokitika, me te moni punga o £300 i ngā hea £1 uara, te Westport Times and Star, ka hurihia te ingoa ki te Buller Times. Nō te 1 o Noema, 1941 i mutu te whakaputanga. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;John Ballance established the Wanganui Herald in 1867. He 
       was prominent in local and national politics and was leader of 
       the first Liberal government and premier of New Zealand from 1891 
       until he died in 1893.&lt;/p&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;Ballance arrived in Wanganui in 1865 where he set up a shop. He 
       was soon drawn into journalism through his interest in local 
       issues. He wrote occasionally for the Wanganui Times, which at 
       that time was the rival of the established newspaper the 
       Wanganui Chronicle.&lt;/p&gt;       
       &lt;p&gt;In 1867 Ballance bought a press and started a daily newspaper 
       called the Evening Herald, using the paper to express his 
       strong political opinions. He was a member of the Wanganui 
       cavalry troop but was particularly critical of the way military 
       campaigns were conducted against the Māori in the Wanganui area. 
       For this he was arrested and threatened with court martial. 
       Ballance also used the Herald to attack the Chronicle who 
       responded equally strongly. This spirited competition continued 
       until the papers merged in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;       
       &lt;p&gt;Despite losing money in its early years, the Wanganui Herald 
       established itself as a viable concern. Between 1869 and 1906 
       it also published the Weekly Herald (later called the Yeoman). 
       From 1926 it published a children's newspaper as an insert, 
       which was a first for a New Zealand newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;       
       &lt;p&gt;In 1971 the ownership of the Herald and the Chronicle merged. 
       Wanganui, like other New Zealand towns and cities, was unable 
       to sustain two daily newspapers although it managed this for 
       longer than most other places in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;       
       &lt;p&gt;The Herald was replaced in 1986 by a community newspaper with 
       the same name leaving its great rival, the Chronicle, to 
       continue as Wanganui's only daily newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I tīmataia e Te Paranihi (John Ballance) te Wanganui Herald i te tau 1867. He tangata rongonui ia i roto i ngā āhuatanga tōrangapū ā-rohe, ā-motu hoki. Ko ia hoki te Kaiārahi o te Kāwanatanga Rīpera (Liberal) tuatahi, ā, ko ia hoki te Pirimia o Niu Tīreni mai i te tau 1891 tae noa ki te tau i mate ia, arā, 1893.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tae mai a Te Paranihi ki Wanganui i te tau 1865, ā, ka whakatuwheratia e ia he toa. I muri tata i tēnā, ka tīmata tana tuhituhi i runga i te mea he kaingākau ia ki ngā take ā-rohe. I ētahi wā ka tuhi kōrero ia mō te nūpepa ko te Wanganui Times. Koinei hoki te nūpepa tāwhai ki te nūpepa rongonui o taua wā nā, ko te Wanganui Chronicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I te tau 1867 ka hokona e Te Paranihi tētahi mīhini perehi, ā, ka tīmataia e ia te nūpepa o ia rā, arā, te Evening Herald, ā, i roto i taua nūpepa ka whakapuakina e ia āna whakaaro tōrangapu. Ahakoa he hōia ia i roto i te ope eke hōiho o Wanganui, ka rite tonu tana whakahē i ngā whakahau pakanga ki ngā Māori o te rohe o Wanganui. Mō tēnei mahi, ka hopukina ia, ā, ka whakawehia ia kia whakawākia i te aroaro o te kōti taua. I tua i tēnā, ka rite tonu a Te Paranihi ki te tuhituhi i roto i te Herald āna korero whakahē i te Chronicle. Tino pukuriri hoki ngā kōrero whakautu a te Chronicle. Ka pēnei tonu te mahi o aua nūpepa tae noa ki te tekau tau mai i 1970, i reira ka hanumia aua nūpepa nā.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahakoa ka rite tonu te pakaru o te pēke o te Wanganui Herald i te tīmatanga, ka pakari haere i ngā tau o muri tae anō ki te wā ka tino kaha ake. Mai i te tau 1869 ki te tau 1906, ka tāngia hoki te Weekly Herald (i ngā tau o muri ka tapaina ko te Yeoman). Mai i te tau 1926, ka tāngia he nūpepa mō ngā tamariki ka whakaurua ki roto i te Herald. Koinā te tīmatanga o tēnā momo wāhanga nūpepa ki Aotearoa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I te tau 1971 ka tūhonohono ngā nūpepa e rua, arā, te Herald me te Chronicle. I pēnei hoki nō te mea kāhore e taea e te tāone o Wanganui te tautoko i ngā nūpepa e rua. Ahakoa i pēnei ai, ko Wanganui tētahi o ngā tāone o Aotearoa i tino kaha ki te tautoko i ngā nūpepa e rua mō te wā roa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I te tau 1986 ka uru mai he nūpepa hapori e kīia nei ko te Wanganui Herald. I tēnei nā ka mahue ko te Wanganui Chronicle te nūpepa o ia rā anake i Wanganui.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Essay language="en">
    &lt;p&gt;Gold was first discovered at Waihi, to the south of the Coromandel Peninsula, in 1878. In 1882 the first battery was breaking gold-bearing rock at the Martha Mine which was later one of the world’s most significant gold and silver mines. &lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt; By the mid-1890s, Waihi had a sufficiently settled population to encourage Messrs Galbraith and Vercker-Bindon to start a bi-weekly, the Waihi Miner and Hauraki Goldfields Gazette. The Waihi Chronicle, part-owned by William Wallnutt, later long-time Waihi mayor, sharebroker and contributor to other papers, became a daily competitor in 1900, forcing the Waihi Miner to follow suit. The unprofitable impasse was soon to be resolved. &lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt;It is likely that William Geddis, co-owner of Auckland’s New Zealand Observer, with William Blomfield, was interested in Waihi because he was chairman of directors of the Rising Sun Gold Mining Company which operated a mine at Owharoa between Paeroa and Waihi. In the event, with some financial assistance from the Auckland Star’s Henry Brett, Geddis purchased the Waihi Miner. In 1901, the Geddis-Blomfield partnership renamed the paper the Waihi Daily Telegraph. The last issue of the Waihi Chronicle was on 1 March 1901; the first issue of the Waihi Daily Telegraph, billed as an up-to-date, one penny evening daily, appeared three days later. It printed a wide range of overseas cables as well as local news and was a steadfast supporter of the mining industry. &lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt; One typical editorial, in March 1905, was highly critical of the Hon James McGowan, Minister of Mines, who had made his portfolio ‘.... a comfortable means to a comfortable end’ and ‘has displayed parsimony towards the industry that he ought to have fostered, but it is reassuring to learn on such high authority [Prime Minister Seddon] that the era of parsimony is at an end, and that the goldfields industry is to receive the encouragement that its importance warrants ....’ &lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt; Despite his Auckland newspaper interests, Geddis settled in Waihi for a number of years. As well as securing the newspaper’s future, Geddis was elected to the first Waihi Borough Council in 1902. He left Waihi in 1908 to edit and manage the Napier Daily Telegraph, bought in partnership with Henry Brett and T W Leys. &lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt; The Waihi Daily Telegraph was subsequently run by Nisbet McRobie, formerly manager of the New Zealand Times in Wellington and later president of the Auckland Master Printers Association. At this time Waihi had three times the population of Hamilton and was the Auckland province’s fastest-growing town.  There was competition from the Waihi Times for a period from 1906, but more serious economically to both the town and newspaper was the 1912 miners’ strike. &lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt; When McRobie left in 1915, the Waihi Daily Telegraph reverted to Geddis and Blomfield for a period. From 1919, W H Toy, previously on the literary staff of the New Zealand Herald, became owner and editor. Like William Geddis, he served on the Waihi Borough Council.  From the 1920s the newspaper was published two or three times a week.  After Toy’s death in 1936, his son, W A Toy, ran the paper until 1951. Then a weekly, it stopped publication shortly after the Waihi Gazette set up in opposition. &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt; I kitea tuatahitia te kōura i Waihi, i te pito tonga o te Tara o te Ika a Māui, i te tau 1878. Nō te tau 1882 ka tīmata te kuru tuatahi hei wāwāhi i ngā toka pupuru kōura i te keringa o Martha, ka huri i roto i te wā hei keringa hira rawa atu i te ao katoa mō te kōura me te hiriwa. &lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt; Nō te taenga ki waenga i ngā tau 1890-1900, he maha tonu te taupori āta noho i Waihi,  koia i huri ai a Galbraith rāua ko Vercker-Bindon ki te tīmata i te niupepa rua putanga i te wiki, ko te ingoa ko te Waihi Miner and Hauraki Goldfields Gazette. Ka whai i muri ko te Waihi Chronicle, ā, ka eke hei tino hoa tauwhāinga ia rā i te tau 1900, i huri ai te Waihi Miner kia pērā anō ana putanga. Ko te rangatira o tētahi wāhi o ngā hea o taua niupepa o te Chronicle ko William Wallnutt, he koromatua nō te tāone o Waihi mō te wā roa, he kaipupuru hea, he kaiāwhina hoki i ētahi atu pepa.

         &lt;p&gt; Ko te take i huri ai a William Geddis tētahi kaipupuru ngātahi o te New Zealand Observer, i Tāmaki-makau-rau, me tana hoa a William Blomfield. Te āhua nei ko te take i huri ai a Geddis ki te whaiwhai i ngā āhuatanga o Waihi nā te mea koia te heamana kaitohutohu o te Rising Sun Gold Mining Company nāna i whakahaere tētahi keringa i Owharoa i waenga i Paeroa meWaihi. I te tukunga iho, ka hokona e Geddis te Waihi Miner, ko Henry Brett o te Auckland Star te kaiāwhina mō te taha moni. Nō te tau 1901, nā te tokorua nei nā Geddis-Blomfield i whakaingoa te niupepa ko te Waihi Daily Telegraph. Ko te putanga whakamutunga o te Waihi Chronicle i te 1 March 1901; ā, e toru rā i muri mai ka hokona te putanga tuatahi  o te Waihi Daily Telegraph, i kīa e ōna rangatira he niupepa whai pūrongo mohoa, he niupepa mō ia rā, kotahi kapa te utu. Ka tāngia e te pepa te huhuatanga o ngā waea mai i tāwāhi, tae atu ki ngā pūrongo o te wā kāinga, ā, he tino kaitautoko ia mō te ahumahi keri whenua. &lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt; Ka whakaputaina e ia tētahi tuhinga etita i te marama o Poutūterangi 1905, i ātete atu ki te Honore James McGowan, te Minita mō ngā Keringa, e mōhio ana tātou ko tāna mahi matua i tana tūnga  'he whaiwhai noa iho i te moni kia rangatira ai tana noho', ā, 'i matapiko rā ki te ahumahi e tika ana kia taurimatia e ia. Engari he pai ki te rongo i ngā kupu a te tino tohunga [a Te Pirimia a  Seddon] kua mutu ngā wā o te matapiko, kua huri ia ki te atawhai me te tiaki i te ahumahi keringa, kia eke ai ki tōna tūnga teitei, kia rite ki tōna hiranga...' &lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt; Ahakoa ana hea i ngā niupepa o Tāmaki-makau-rau, ka noho a Geddis ki Waihi mō ētahi tau. I tua atu i te whakaū i te noho o te niupepa, ka pōtitia a Geddis ki te Kaunihera tuatahi o te rohe o Waihi i te tau 1902. Ka wehe atu i Waihi i te tau 1908 ki te whakatika ki te whakahaere hoki i te Daily Telegraph o Ahuriri, he mea hoko ngātahi me Henry Brett rāua ko T W Leys. &lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt; Nō muri mai ka whakahaeretia te Waihi Daily Telegraph e Nisbet McRobie, koia te kaiwhakahaere o mua o te New Zealand Times i Te Whanga-nui-a-Tara, koia hoki te tumuaki o te Auckland Master Printers Association. I taua wā e toru ngā tāngata o te taupori o Waihi ki te tangata kotahi o te taupori o Kirikiriroa, koia hoki te tāone tere rawa te tupu o te takiwā o Tāmaki-makau-rau.  I noho anō te Waihi Times hei hoa tauwhāinga mō te wā mai i 1906, engari ko te tino raruraru nui i pā ki te tāone me te niupepa i te taha ōhanga ko te tū-te-ihu a ngā kaikeri o te tau 1912.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt; Nō te wehenga atu o McRobie i te tau 1915, ka hoki te Waihi Daily Telegraph ki a Geddis rāua ko Blomfield mō tētahi wā. Mai i 1919, ka noho a W H Toy hei rangatira, hei etita hoki. He kaimahi ia i te taha tuhituhi  o te New Zealand Herald i mua. He rite tonu ki a William Geddis, arā, ka uru ia ki te Kaunihera o  te rohe o Waihi.  Mai i ngā tau mai i 1920 e rua, e toru rānei ngā putanga o te niupepa i te wiki.  I muri i te matenga o Toy i te tau 1936, ka huri tana tama a W A Toy ki te whakahaere i te pepa taea noatia te tau 1951. He niupepa ā-wiki ia i taua wā, ā, ka mutu tana puta ki ao i muri tata tonu iho i te whakatūnga o te Waihi Gazette hei hoa tauwhāinga. &lt;/p&gt;

    <Description language="en">The first issue of the Wellington Independent was published on 2 April 1845. For a time it was considered one of the best newspapers in New Zealand and it had considerable influence. However, it failed to grow in the 1860s and early 1870s and, despite changing from bi-weekly to tri-weekly publication, was replaced by the New Zealand Times in 1874.</Description>

    <Essay language="en">
    &lt;p&gt;The history of the Wellington Independent is interwoven with 
       that of other early newspapers in the Capital, particularly the 
       New Zealand Spectator and Cook's Strait Guardian (1844-1865) 
       and the New Zealand Gazette and Britannia Spectator (1839-1844).&lt;/p&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Spectator began in Wellington in 1844 immediately 
       after the demise of the Gazette (which was New Zealand's first 
       newspaper). In 1845 the Spectator's owners sacked the printers 
       of the paper after they ran a provocative advertisement. As a 
       result the printers decided to set up a rival paper - the Wellington 
       Independent.&lt;/p&gt;       
       &lt;p&gt;The first issue of the Independent came out on 2 April 1845 but 
       publication stopped four months later when the paper's equipment 
       was sold to the Spectator to pay off its owner's debts. The owner 
       of the equipment, Samuel Revans, had previously edited the Gazette 
       and had also supplied the provocative advertisement to the Spectator 
       that led to the printers being sacked. By November that year the 
       Independent got another press and soon established itself as the 
       more popular paper. It went on to outlive the Spectator by nine 
       years.&lt;/p&gt;       
       &lt;p&gt;The Independent was more popular because it advocated for 
       representative government against the Spectator, which supported 
       Governor George Grey's preference for continuing with colonial 
       rule.&lt;/p&gt;       
       &lt;p&gt;According to GH Scholefield (Newspapers in New Zealand, 1958) the 
       Independent was one of the best newspapers in New Zealand. It had 
       considerable influence, which can be seen from the contributors who 
       included James Edward Wakefield, William Fox, Edward Stafford and 
       Dillon Bell.&lt;/p&gt;       
       &lt;p&gt;The paper failed to expand in the 1860s and 1870s but was still 
       a going concern when it was replaced by the New Zealand Times in 
       1874. In 1873 it was sold to Julius Vogel's New Zealand Times Company. 
       Vogel planned to publish a national newspaper from Wellington to be 
       used to further his political ambitions. In 1874 he replaced the 
       Independent with his new paper the New Zealand Times which continued 
       the serial numbering from the Independent. The Times didn't become 
       a national paper but it did continue until 1927, when it was absorbed 
       by the Dominion.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Kō ngā kōrero tawhito o te Wellington Independent e kī ana i ngā kōrero mai i ētahi atu o ngā nūpepa tōmua o te tāone matua pērā i te New Zealand Spectator me te Cook's Straits Guardian (1844-1865) tae atu ana te New Zealand Gazette me te Britannia Spectator (1839-1844).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tīmata te New Zealand Spectator i Pōneke i te tau 1844 i muri tonu i te ngaromanga o te Gazette (te nūpepa tuatahi o Aotearoa). I te tau 1845 ka whakamutua e ngā rangatira o te Spectator ngā kaitā o te nūpepa mō tā rātou whakaputa i tētahi pānui taki. Mai i tērā kātahi ka huri aua kaitā ki te hanga i tētahi atu nūpepa kē, ko te Wellington Independent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tāngia tuatahitia te Wellington Independent i te 2 o Paenga-whāwhā 1845, ēngari i mutu noa i ngā marama e whā i muri mai i te hokonga o ngā taputapu o taua nūpepa ki te Spectator hei utu i ngā nama a ōna rangatira. Ko te kaipupuri o aua taputapu a Samuel Revans, i tū hei ētita mō te Gazette i mua atu, ā, nāna hoki te mahi ki te whakaputa i te pānui taki ki te Spectator i whakamutua ai ngā kaitā. I Whiringa-ā-rangi o taua tau ka whiwhi te Independent i tētahi atu mīhini perehi, ā, kīhai i roa ka tū kē mai hei nūpepa i paingia e te nuinga. I tū kē mai mō ngā tau e iwa i muri mai i te mutunga o te Spectator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I piki ake ai te painga o te Independent nā tōna tautoko kia whakatūria he kāwanatanga tā te nuinga e whakatau ai me tohu kia rerekē atu ai ki tā te Spectator me tana tautoko i te kawe a Kāwana Hōri Kerei kia ū tonu ki te kāwanatanga koroni.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ki tā GH Scholefield (Newspapers in New Zealand, 1958) ko te Independent tētahi o ngā tino nūpepa o Aotearoa. Ka nui anō te whai mana meina ka tirohia ake ngā kaituku kōrero pērā i James Edward Wakefield, Te Pōkiha (William Fox), Edward Stafford me Dillon Bell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kīhai i whakawhānui ake te nūpepa nei i te tekau tau mai i 1860 me te tekau tau mai i 1870, ēngari e haere tonu ana i te wā i riro ai ia te New Zealand Times i te tau 1874.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hokona atu ki te kamupene a Julius Vogel, ko te New Zealand Times Company, i te tau 1873. Ko te whakaaro a Vogel kia hangāia he nūpepa ā-motu hei kawe i ōna ake wawata tōrangapū. I te tau 1874 ka hurihia e ia te Independent ki tana nūpepa hōu, ko te New Zealand Times, i kawea tonu hoki ngā rārangi tatau mai i te Independent. Kīhai te Times i tū hei nūpepa ā-motu ēngari i tū tae noa ki te tau 1927, arā, te tau i riro ai ki raro i te maru o te Dominion.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Waikato Times began life as the tri-weekly Waikato Times 
         and Thames Valley Gazette, on 2 May 1872.&lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt;The owner was the enthusiastic newspaperman George Jones and the editor 
         Henry Holloway, who had considerable experience in New Zealand newspapers. 
         The paper was first published in Ngaruawahia but moved to Hamilton in 1875. 
         At this time Jones sold out of the paper (now the Waikato Times) and the 
         Bank of New Zealand and Auckland lawyer Frederick Whitaker bought a 
         controlling influence.&lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt;From 1878 George Edgecumbe, local body politician and real estate agent, 
         became the paper's business manager. In 1896 the Bank cancelled Edgecumbe's 
         lease and sold the Times to James Shiner Bond. Edgecumbe left to start the 
         Waikato Argus and took with him the editor, Henry Holloway, as well as the 
         files, advertising contacts and goodwill.&lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt;After initially contemplating legal action, Bond focussed on the task of 
         rebuilding the paper, merging his Cambridge newspaper, the Waikato Advocate, 
         with the Times. He converted it to a daily (evening) publication. The new 
         editor was Sydney Greville Smith.&lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt;The Times and the Argus competed for 20 years, in business and politics, 
         until merging in 1915. The new Waikato Times was now politically independent, 
         but became a powerful voice for promoting the region's development. During 
         the 1920s new linotype and then stereotype presses enabled the paper to 
         significantly increase its the print run in order to meet an increasing 
         circulation demand from a growing population.&lt;/p&gt;         
         &lt;p&gt;From 1968 to 1976 the paper was known simply as the Times. No new competitors 
         emerged and it continues as a daily to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Nō te 2 o Haratua 1872 i tīmata ai te Waikato Times hei Waikato Times and Thames Valley Gazette, e toru ngā putanga ia wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ko George Jones tōna rangatira, he kaingākaunui ki te mahi nūpepa. Ko Henry Holloway tōna ētita, he tautōhito i ngā āhuatanga o ngā nūpepa o Niu Tīreni. I tā tuatahitia i Ngāruawāhia, ēngari ka nukuhia ki Kirikiriroa i te tau 1875. I taua wā ka hokona te nūpepa (i taua wā ko te ingoa ko te Waikato Times) e Jones, ka riro te mana whakahaere i te Pēke o Niu Tīreni rāua ko Frederick Whitaker, he rōia i ākarana.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mai i te tau 1878, ko te kaiwhakahaere pakihi ko George Edgecumbe, he kaitōrangapū o te rohe, he kaihoko rawa whenua hoki. I te tau 1896 ka whakakorea te rīhi a Edgecumbe e te Pēke, ka hokona ai ki a James Shiner Bond. Ka wehe atu a Edgecumbe me te ētita, a Henry Holloway, ngā kōnae kōrero, ngā kirimana pānuitanga, me te kaingākaunui a te iwi, kia whakatū tētahi nūpepa kē, arā, te Waikato Argus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ka mutu te whakaaro ki te hāmene, ka whakapau a Bond i ōna kaha ki te whakahou i te nūpepa, me te hono i te Times ki tāna nūpepa i Horotiu (Cambridge), ko te Waikato Advocate. Ka hurihia hei putanga o ia rā e whakaputaina ana i te ahiahi. Ko Sydney Greville Smith te ētita hou.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mō ngā tau e 20 ka tauwhāinga te Times me te Argus, ā-pakihi ā-tōrangapū hoki, tae noa ki te hononga i te tau 1915. Kāore he kōaro tōrangapū o te Waikato Times hou, ēngari he tino reo mō te whakatairanga i ngā whanaketanga o te rohe. I te tekau tau mai i 1920, nā te perehi whakarārangi (Linotype), kātahi ko te perehi tīwharawhara (stereotype), i āhei ai te nūpepa kia maha ake āna kape ki te whakangata i ngā hiahia a te tupu o te tokomaha kē ake o te taupori.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mai i te tau 1968 ki te tau 1976 i mōhiotia whānuitia ko te Times. Kāore he nūpepa whakataetae hou i puta mai, ā, e haere tonu nei i tēnei wā hei nūpepa e tāngia ana ia rā, ia rā.&lt;/p&gt;
