Ivess sold the Akaroa Mail a year later and there were several  owners before, in 1881, the paper was bought by Howard C Jacobson.  The Jacobson family was to own and run the newspaper for 71 years. </p>     <p> H C Jacobson, from Devon and educated at King’s College, London, was a school teacher before becoming, with Joseph Ivess, a part-owner of the Ashburton Mail, begun in 1877. Sale of his interest in the Ashburton paper helped fund his purchase of the Akaroa Mail. He was to run the newspaper until his death in 1910.  </p>     <p> His daughter Ethel May Jacobson, the seventh of 14 children, excelled at Christchurch Girls’ High School and subsequently gained BA and MA degrees in English and French from Canterbury College. She was teaching in Nelson when, in 1903, her father became ill and called her home to help run the Akaroa Mail.  She soon became editor and took full control from 1907, three years before her father died.  She was then the legal owner, manager and editor. For almost 50 years, certainly a record, Ethel Jacobson was to remain the Akaroa Mail editor. Later, her younger brother, William took care of the business side of the paper. In time, there were four staff in the printing department.  </p>     <p> Possibly Ethel Jacobson’s greatest achievement was her growing acceptance as a pioneering women editor at a time when the role was considered a male preserve. She was to become a familiar figure, with wide-brimmed hat and hobnailed boots, riding side-saddle over Banks Peninsula’s hilly terrain to report meetings and events. There were also launch trips to Pigeon Bay and Port Levy to ensure the detailed coverage that makes the newspaper an invaluable record of Banks Peninsula life. The newspaper was also, during her long editorship, widely respected for the standard of its journalism and high quality printing.  </p>     <p> Ethel  Jacobson, who never married, retired in 1952 and died, 88 years old, in 1965. The year she retired the Akaroa Mail was sold to George R Dobbie, who had worked for the Christchurch Star-Sun, and subsequently edited the newspaper for a number of years.   In the early 1980s there was a decline in editorial standards and stock photographs were used frequently and often inappropriately. </p> <p>      </p> <p> Publication, continuous since 1876, was interrupted for two months in 1985 before publisher-editor Michael de Hamel took over, restored the previously high standards and substantially increased the paper’s circulation.  </p> <p>     </p> </div>"},

With ambitions beyond his clerkship at one of Auckland’s morning dailies, the Southern Cross, William Ferrar placed an advertisement seeking a partner in a publishing venture. A former Presbyterian minister, the Rev George McCullagh Reed, responded while passing through Auckland on his way back to Australia from the West Coast goldfields, and the two men met. Despite having little capital, no influential friends and minimal experience, they quickly agreed to begin an afternoon paper, of more liberal persuasion, in opposition to the Evening News. Julius Vogel, manager of the Southern Cross, agreed to print copies of the four page paper, with Reed, who had some writing ability, the editor and Ferrar selling advertisements. </p> <p>   </p> <p>  However, Reed unwisely pushed his temperance views in a town with a proliferation of pubs and taverns; more wisely he sought the advice of the New Zealand Herald’s £5 a week waterfront reporter Henry Brett. Advising that the lack of hard news was the problem, Brett took a third interest in the paper and was soon in charge with a young friend, Thomson Wilson Leys, formerly sub-editor of the Southern Cross, joining him.  George Reed continued as editor until 1875, when Leys took over the role.  </p> <p>   </p> <p>  Brett became sole proprietor of the newspaper which was renamed the Auckland Evening Star in 1879 and Auckland Star in 1887. Brett and Leys subsequently formed a commercial partnership and successive generations of both families continued to play leading roles.  The Brett Printing and Publishing Co. Ltd. became a public company in 1920. In 1929, following the purchase of the Lyttelton Times and Christchurch Star, the company became New Zealand Newspapers Ltd. </p> <p>   </p> <p> The newspaper’s growing success through the last decades of the nineteenth century was largely due to Brett’s commitment to providing as up-to-the moment news as possible. Before Auckland was linked to the telegraph, staff boarded arriving ships at the harbour entrance in specially-built boats to pick up English and Australian newspapers. Brett also used a dozen pigeons, from a Tasmanian breeder, to carry daily news from the Thames goldfields and from Tauranga where the telegraph line from Wellington ended in the early 1870s. </p> <p>   </p> <p> It was claimed that the Evening Star had a circulation of 2,700 copies in 1872, rising to 4,700 three years later. In 1884, now the Auckland Evening Star, the paper’s circulation had reached 10,000. In 1898, Brett claimed the Auckland Star had the country’s largest afternoon circulation – 15,000 copies a day. </p> <p>   </p> <p>  The Star was one of the first newspapers in New Zealand to replace hand setting of type with linotype machines. It was also one of the first dailies to make regular use of photographs; the separate weekly magazine, the New Zealand Graphic, begun by Henry Brett in 1890, was illustrated from the beginning. </p> <p>   </p> <p>  The Auckland Star was a major, innovative metropolitan daily until the early 1960s. Weakened, as most afternoon papers were, by the introduction of television, the Star, and NZ Newspapers Ltd., fell prey to a corporate raider, and ceased publication in 1991. </p> <p>     </p> </div>"},

There was widespread Maori adoption of the new Pai Maire religion and the teachings of prophet Te Ua Haumene were peaceful, but the murder of Europeans in the Bay of Plenty by Hau Hau followers resulted in the confiscation of Ngati Awa’s lands.  Following Te Kooti’s raid on Whakatane in 1869, there was a determined effort by European settlers and local Maori to re-establish community and economic life in the township. </p> <p> </p> <p> Whakatane had a population of a little over 200 when the first attempt was made to establish a newspaper. The Whakatane Times and Opouriao Advocate began its short life in 1899 but there were not sufficient readers or advertisers for it to survive beyond its first two months.  The paper edited by H G Walmsley, was backed by Daniel McGarvey, a one-time compositor on Auckland’s Southern Cross.  </p> <p> </p> <p> In 1901 there were 781 Europeans and between 3-4,000 Maori in Whakatane County. The township’s population had risen sufficiently by 1907 for the Whakatane County Press, using the Times plant, to have more sustained success. The owner, Charles Gibbs Beckett, was well-known for starting newspapers. </p> <p> </p> <p>  According to the Thames Star in January 1907: ‘Mr C G Beckett bids fair to rival the fame of Mr Joseph Ivess as a newspaper ‘planter’. He is the proprietor of the Northern Wairoa Times, the Whangarei Morning Press and the Waihi Times, and he is now establishing a fourth at Whakatane, to be known as the Whakatane County Press. Years ago Mr Beckett established several papers in the Wairarapa district, and for some time he owned the Inglewood Record.’  </p> <p> </p> <p> Following the paper’s first issue on 14 January Wellington’s Evening Post  reported  that it ‘is a double-demy sheet, and claims to be the first penny paper in the Bay of Plenty. As befits a county paper, it gives full prominence to local news and local requirements.’ It  appeared three times a week and was published in the morning. It may have been a daily for a time in 1916. </p> <p> </p> <p> One newspaper, at least, was less welcoming.  In December 1907 the Bay of Plenty Times commented:  ‘We notice that the Whakatane County Press makes very free  with the articles in this paper by publishing them in its leading columns as original matter. We have no objection to incompetent papers copying our articles, provided they acknowledge their source instead of stealing them.’ </p> <p> </p> <p> During the period 1916-1921 Whakatane was the fastest growing town in New Zealand, contributing factors being the congenial climate, fertile alluvial plains and lower hill country and the increasing importance of the port at Whakatane. Forestry, fishing, and dairying were all important. </p> <p> </p> <p> In 1919 the Whakatane County Press was bought by the Bay of Plenty Printing Company and in 1923 changed back to evening publication. In 1935, it absorbed the East Coast Guardian from Opotiki and the paper’s title was changed to Bay of Plenty Press. The Bay of Plenty Press stopped publication at the beginning of 1939 and two  months later F J Reynolds formed the Beacon Printing and Publishing Company and took over the Press’s machinery. The first issue of the Bay of Plenty Beacon, a tri-weekly, appeared in April 1939. </p> <p> </p> <p> The Whakatane Beacon, as the paper is now called, is a broadsheet publication printed three times a week, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and on Fridays. It has a circulation of about 8,400. The Beacon Printing and Publishing Company also publishes the Bay Weekend, a tabloid newspaper delivered free every Saturday to every home in the greater Eastern Bay area. </p> <p>     </p> </div>"},

The paper changed hands several more times over the next fifty years. Reginald Augustus Pyke was probably the most significant of the later owners. Pyke ran and edited the paper several times between 1896 and 1915. His editorial policy was unashamedly parochial as he used the Herald to advance the economic interests of Milton and Bruce County. His lobbying, through the pages of the Herald, was instrumental in attracting a woollen mill to the town. The mill was for many years one of the main employers in Milton.</p> \t\t<p>The Bruce Herald had a number of rivals in Milton between 1866 and 1910. The most notable were the Bruce Independent (1866-1867) and the Milton Mirror (1905-1910). The Independent provided some real competition for the short time it ran. Under Edward T. Gillon the paper gained much attention locally for its strong anti-provincial editorial policy. The impact of the Independent was such that the Herald increased the size of its issues from 4 to 8 pages. However Gallon’s views were too strong or at least too vigorously expressed for the directors of the Independent and the paper was wound up in 1867. The Milton Mirror was published by Charles Lewis Grant, a former employee of the Herald. The Mirror met with some success but was taken over by the Herald after a fire destroyed the Mirror’s office in 1910.</p> \t\t<p>The Herald ceased publication on 7 October 1971.</p>     </div>"},

		    "<div class=\"inner-contentwrap\">       <p>The Southern Cross was started as a weekly paper in Auckland in 1843 by prominent businessman and aspiring politician, William Brown. It was one of the two early newspapers in Auckland that ran for any length of time, the other being its main rival, the New Zealander.</p>     <p>The first editor of the Southern Cross was Samuel Martin who had earlier edited the New Zealand Herald and Auckland Gazette for a short time in 1842.</p>     <p>Despite the existence of two other papers in Auckland at the time (the Auckland Chronicle and Auckland Times) the Southern Cross developed reasonably well until 1845, when war with Māori in Northland adversely affected business in Auckland. As a result the paper stop publishing from April 1845 to July 1847.</p>     <p>In 1847 Campbell revived the Southern Cross to counteract another Auckland newspaper, the New Zealander which had started two years earlier in June 1845. The two papers represented the rival factions in Auckland politics. The New Zealander supported the ordinary settler and Māori while the Southern Cross supported the land claimants and vigorously attacked Governor George Grey's administration.</p>     <p>At this time there was nothing unusual in the highly partisan attitudes of these papers. Before 1870, newspapers in New Zealand were primarily set up for political purposes. In the absence of self-government newspapers were the main way that those who weren't officials could participate in government.</p>     <p>In 1862 the Southern Cross became the first daily newspaper in Auckland, changing its name to the Daily Southern Cross. The New Zealander soon followed suit.</p>     <p>In 1869 Julius Vogel assumed control of the paper but left to take up national office before he could do much with it, selling his interest in 1873. The paper had always struggled to pay its way. In the 1870s the owners were faced with the expense of shifting (the Improvement Commissioners planned to put a street through their property) and unable to agree on the direction that the paper should take. They decided to sell up instead. Alfred Horton bought the paper in 1876 and went into partnership with the Wilson brothers who owned the New Zealand Herald. At the end of that year the Southern Cross was incorporated into the Herald.</p>     <p>The Southern Cross had started the Weekly News in 1863 and when the Southern Cross was incorporated into the Herald, the Weekly News was merged with the Weekly Herald to become the Auckland Weekly News.</p>     <p>The New Zealander and the Southern Cross are good examples of the way the country's press was politically aligned at the time and this was mirrored in other centres around New Zealand.</p>     </div>"},

With a liberal political stance – equal rights and opportunities for all – it was launched to combat the dominance of powerful land interests, and campaigned from the beginning for the break-up of the largest land blocks in Hawke's Bay.  Managing-director and founding editor, Richard Halkett Lord, a London journalist, even suffered a horsewhipping when his witty and pungent pen outraged a reader.  However, the founding company was soon in financial difficulties and was wound-up 12 months later.  </p> <p>      </p> <p> The newspaper was then taken over by four of its principal shareholders: Edward W Knowles (merchant), George E Lee (barrister), Alexander Kennedy and Thomas K Newton. None had a journalistic background, but Robert Price, who replaced Richard Lord, remained editor until 1893. </p> <p>      </p> <p> The Daily Telegraph’s coverage was in sharp contrast to the more conservative, ‘establishment’ views expressed by its already well-established competitor, the Hawke's Bay Herald, which moved from bi-weekly to daily publication early in 1871 in response to  the appearance of the new paper.  </p> <p>      </p> <p> Initially, the Daily Telegraph consisted of four (48cm x 34cm) pages, each with five columns. Usually six of the 20 columns carried news, with advertising filling the other 14. Advertising cost 3s per inch and the newspaper sold for 2d. Typesetting was by hand and the paper was printed on a single-sheet hand press.  </p> <p>      </p> <p> In 1879, the Daily Telegraph and Hawke's Bay Herald’s circulations hovered around the 1,500 copies a day mark, but from 1880 the evening paper began to outpace its morning rival.  </p> <p>      </p> <p> The Daily Telegraph office in Tennyson Street, Napier was completely destroyed during a major fire on December 18 1886. For a period, until new premises were built, a small news sheet was produced every evening at a local printing office.   </p> <p>      </p> <p> By 1891, with the retirement of his partners, Edward Knowles had become sole proprietor and in 1908 when he, in turn, retired, the newspaper company was sold to the already substantial Auckland newspaper group controlled by Henry Brett, Thomson W Leys and William J Geddis.  Geddis, a member of the Legislative Council, became managing-director, beginning a long family association with the newspaper. His son Trevor M Geddis,  succeeded him as managing-director in 1921 and became editor in 1929, remaining in that position until 1951. </p> <p>       </p> <p> Until 1982, Daily Telegraph ownership had remained in the hands of descendants of the three families that bought the newspaper in 1908, but in that year it merged with the Hawke's Bay Herald-Tribune.   Two years later the new company became part of New Zealand News, then a Brierley Investments subsidiary. In 1988, New Zealand News sold its Hawke's Bay interests to Wilson &amp; Horton which, in turn, was bought by APN NZ in 1996.  Although the companies behind the two Hawke's Bay newspapers had come together in 1982, it was not until 1999 that the Daily Telegraph and Hawke's Bay Herald-Tribune merged to become Hawke's Bay Today.  </p> <p>     </p> </div>"},

		    "<div class=\"inner-contentwrap\">       <p> The Dominion was launched on the first Dominion Day, September 26, 1907, with the specific purpose of providing a strong conservative voice in the capital where the other morning paper, the New Zealand Times, was poorly run and had a Liberal Party heritage, and the much stronger Evening Post was more interested in business than party politics. </p>     <p> When the morning daily was launched  just a year after Richard John Seddon’s death, the Liberals had been in power for 16 years and would be for another five. However, under Sir Joseph Ward, the party was in decline while the Dominion’s directors and shareholders were an impressive list of  leading conservative MPs and substantial Canterbury, Hawke's Bay and Wairarapa runholders. Of particular concern to them were the Liberal policies on labour laws, pensions and land tenure, including the break-up of large rural estates. Unsurprisingly, the newspaper was a persuasive promoter of William Massey’s Reform Party and its policies.  </p>     <p>  The first editor – and he held that position, except for three years in the 1930s, until 1950 – was Charles Westwood Earle. He was also the newspaper company’s managing-director for much of the period and well-attuned to the singular requirements of his Wellington Publishing Company board. While landowner interests were pushed and ‘labour agitators’ attacked, the newspaper also supported good working conditions and backed free education. More predictably, the Dominion promoted free trade within the British Empire, sat on the fence over liquor issues, and advocated a ‘white NZ’ immigration policy. From the beginning, the newspaper’s ambitions stretched well beyond the urban confines of Wellington. There was a strong emphasis on farming news to attract readers in the Wairarapa, Manawatu and Hawke's Bay, with correspondents in Masterton, Palmerston North and Hastings. The paper’s initial circulation of 2,600 had risen to 20,500 by 1914. </p>     <p> By 1927, the Wellington Publishing Company was in a strong enough position to buy and close down the New Zealand Times. A year later it moved into the impressive, purpose-built six-storey building in Mercer Street that it occupied until 1970. </p>      <p> Over the decades, the Dominion’s political stance slowly modified. Shocked by Labour’s 1935 election win, the paper congratulated the new prime minister Michael Joseph Savage but was soon vigorously attacking the government’s ‘socialist’ policies. The hostility of the Dominion and other newspapers led to the launching of the Labour Party’s own daily newspaper, the Southern Cross, in Wellington. It was the first morning opposition to the Dominion – in both political and circulation terms – since the closure of the New Zealand Times. In 1959, eight years after the Southern Cross had closed, Wellington Publishing Company directors reaffirmed their support for the monarchy and British traditions, freedom of speech and private enterprise, but conceded there might be occasions ‘where the need for state interference was clearly shown’. There was now no direct link to any political party. </p>          <p> In the 1960s, the Dominion supported New Zealand’s involvement in the Vietnam War, but also joined with environmentalists in opposing the raising of Lake Manapouri. The paper introduced front page news in 1963 and pioneered the use of bylines by journalists. Between 1968-1972 it was published as a tabloid before reverting to a broadsheet format. </p>          <p> In 1964, Lord Thomson’s attempt to buy the Wellington Publishing Company triggered a takeover war, with Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch the ultimate beneficiary. The 1965 Media Ownership Act limited ownership of New Zealand media companies to 20 percent, but Murdoch’s share gradually increased to 49 percent – giving his News Corporation effective control – after the legislation was repealed in 1974. In 1972, when the companies owning the Dominion and rival Evening Post merged, the resulting Independent Newspapers Ltd (INL) grew rapidly through a succession of takeovers to become one of two dominant media companies in New Zealand.  </p>          <p> In July 2002, INL’s two Wellington newspapers merged to become the morning Dominion-Post. The next year, Fairfax Media, the Australian media conglomerate, purchased, for $1 billion, most of the publishing interests of INL, including the Dominion-Post. </p>     </div>"},

		    "<div class=\"inner-contentwrap\">       <p>The Evening Post was founded by Henry Blundell and began publication as a daily in Wellington on 8 February 1865. Blundell was born in Dublin in 1813 and worked for nearly 30 years at the Dublin Evening Mail. In 1860 he migrated with his family to Melbourne. Blundell moved to New Zealand in 1863 and worked on the Otago Daily Times. </p>     <p>In 1864 he founded the Havelock Mail. However the Marlborough goldfields were failing at this time and the Mail only lasted a few months, closing in November the same year. Blundell, business partner David Curle, and Blundell’s two sons, John and Henry, then decided to try their luck in Wellington, which at that time did not have a daily newspaper. </p>     <p>Wellington had just become the colony’s capital and the Blundells decided that this, combined with the state of the other newspapers being published in Wellington at the time, made starting a daily newspaper there a sound business proposition. The only rivals to the Post were the tri-weekly Wellington Independent and the New Zealand Advertiser, and the weekly New Zealand Spectator, which was in poor health and closed in August 1865. </p>     <p>There was therefore a strong opportunity for a daily paper in Wellington.The Post was a family business, with father Henry being manager and principal leader writer, and sons Henry junior, John and Louis, who joined the firm on completing his schooling in Dunedin, being typesetters, canvassers and reporters. </p>     <p>The new paper aimed to record every event ‘within a mile of Martin’s fountain’ which lay at the corner of Featherston Street and Lambton Quay. By focussing on local issues, attention to detail and high-quality writing the Post soon established itself as the leading Wellington paper, a position it did not relinquish during its long career. Its editorial policy was politically neutral. Unlike other papers of the time, which were established to publicise a particular political opinion, the Post was not aligned to any political factions and was therefore able to comment freely on political and other matters. As Blundell wrote in the Post’s first edition, ‘a liberal course of policy will be pursued and the bounds of moderation will not be overstepped in giving expression to the views entertained by the proprietors as journalists.’ </p>     <p>Henry Blundell senior died in 1878 and the paper continued to be run by his sons, with Frank Gifford as editor. Perhaps because it was such a locally focussed paper-Wellington’s paper-the Post was able to outlast it various rivals over the years. The Post’s only serious competition was the Dominion, which began publication in September 1907. The Dominion was founded to be the voice of the conservative element in Wellington politics, and as such was at the opposite end of the political spectrum to the Post. This, combined with the fact that the Dominion was a morning rather than an evening paper, meant that serious competition with the Post was not an issue as each had its own niche in the capital city. The Blundell family retained control of the paper until the late 1960s. The 1970s saw a steady decline in the Post’s circulation and the Dominion, which had been somewhat in the Post’s shadow throughout its career, gradually eclipsed its rival. In 1972 ownership of the Post was combined with the Dominion and in 2002 the Post’s owners decided to close the paper and merge it with the Dominion to create the Dominion Post. The final edition of the Evening Post was published on 6 July 2002, ending what has been called a 137-year love affair with Wellington.</p>     </div>"},

		    "<div class=\"inner-contentwrap\">       <p> The Grey River Argus was a rarity amongst New Zealand newspapers in that it was open about its political affiliations. The Argus supported the Labour Movement. For many years the legend, “New Zealand’s pioneer Labor daily” appeared on the masthead. </p>     <p> The Argus was the first newspaper published in Greymouth, the first issue appearing on  14 November 1865. The publisher, James Kerr (1834-1901), had worked on newspapers in Scotland, Melbourne and Dunedin before coming to Greymouth. He became well known throughout the West Coast through his involvement in local and national politics. He was a close friend of Richard Seddon’s and was a member of the Legislative Council. He remained the principal proprietor of the Argus until his death. </p>     <p> Initially the Argus was published three times a week. In 1871 the paper became a daily. From 1870 to 1907 it published a weekly edition called the Weekly Argus. The Argus survived two fires and several floods in its first few years. </p>     <p> The Argus was fortunate to have several very capable editors in the nineteenth century.  These were William Henry Harrison (1831-1879) and Florence Romuald McCarthy (1834-1914). Harrison was editor from 1868 to 1879 and McCarthy from 1880 to 1914. They earned the Argus a national reputation for the quality of its journalism. </p>         <p> Kerr’s son James became manager of the paper after his father’s death and in 1906  formed the Grey River Argus Company. In 1912 the other daily newspaper in Greymouth, the Greymouth Evening Star, considered buying a controlling share in the paper but decided that the price was too high. The next year the Federation of Labour began negotiating with the owners to buy the paper. Most of the New Zealand press were unsympathetic, often hostile, towards Labour. The Federation thought that they needed a paper of their own to counteract this. Buying the Argus made sense given the strong support that Labour enjoyed on the West Coast. </p>         <p> Negotiations were protracted and it wasn’t till 1919 that the West Coast trade unions acquired the paper. However the Argus was, in effect, already a Labour paper by the time it was sold. In 1918 the paper allowed the Grey Labour Representation Committee to use its columns to support Harry Holland contest the Grey seat in that year's election. Future Prime Minister Peter Fraser was responsible for the Labour campaign on the West Coast and wrote editorials for the Argus during this time. The Argus was considered to have contributed to the election of Labour candidates in 1918 for the seats of Grey and Buller.   </p>         <p> The early years of the Argus under union management were difficult. The cost of newsprint was high, advertisers were reluctant to use a Labour paper and a few months after assuming control, fire destroyed the Argus office and plant.

All three had worked together on the New Zealand Times in Wellington and their partnership was forged there.</p> \t\t<p>The first issue appeared on 10 April 1880 and the paper was published twice a week. In 1881 Galvin retired due to ill health and his place was taken by Joseph Armit. However Galvin continued to be involved with newspapers for the rest of his life, founding the short-lived Hawera Morning Post in 1894 and contributing to the New Zealand Times. </p> \t\t<p>The Star saw off a challenge early on from Joseph Ivess, publisher of the nearby Patea Mail. Ivess had been publishing the Patea Mail since 1875 and had ambitions to establish a chain of papers in Taranaki. He tried to persuade Galvin not to set up in Hawera. When Galvin persisted, he opened an office in Hawera, from which he briefly published the Hawera Times. However the residents of Hawera preferred the Star and Ivess abandoned his new paper after two issues.</p> \t\t<p>The Star progressed steadily in its first two decades. In 1882 a new press was installed and the paper began daily publication. In 1885 it started the Egmont Star, a weekly compendium of items from the parent paper for distribution to the backblocks of Taranaki. The Egmont Star ceased in 1914. In 1895 the Hawera Star survived a fire that destroyed the paper's premises and plant.</p> \t\t<p>In 1889 Yorke became sole proprietor; in 1893 he sold the Star to the paper's editor, William Alfred Parkinson. Parkinson ran the paper until his death in 1920. Ownership changed several more times through the 20th century. The paper ceased daily publication in 1977 and became a community paper the following year. It is still published in that form today.</p>     </div>"},

This did not survive and Papworth was then briefly manager, editor and reporter of the Manawatu Farmer. In October the same year the Evening Post reported the court case in which Papworth claimed £500 damages (about $34,000 today) from the Horowhenua Publishing Company for wrongful dismissal. The company claimed ‘disloyalty, negligence, and incompetency’; the judge, in awarding £225 to Papworth, suggested the jury might have reasonably taken the view that ‘the company was anxious to sell the property and to get rid of the defendant for the purpose of facilitating the sale’. Ironically, it was Papworth, possibly using some of the money awarded him, who bought the Manawatu Farmer. In 1909, he renamed it the Horowhenua Daily Chronicle. </p> <p> Herbert G Kerslake and Robert H Billens were the next owners, buying the paper in 1917. With wartime paper shortages, it was published tri-weekly as the Levin Chronicle until daily publication was resumed in 1923. Before Levin was connected to electricity in 1924 the paper’s printing presses and linotypes were water-powered. The waste waster was piped out to the street gutter. </p> <p> In 1944, L A Humphrey, who began his newspaper career as a Chronicle paper boy in 1920, became a director of what was now Kerslake, Billens and Humphrey. Over the years the Daily Chronicle consolidated its position in Levin and Horowhenua, as the town’s population grew strongly from the 1940s to the 1960s. </p> <p> Kerslake, Billens and Humphrey became, in 1960, part of the United Publishing and Printing Company (UPP), headed by the Rotorua Post’s Ray Smith. Wilson &amp; Horton acquired all the shares in UPP in 1985. A decade later Wilson &amp; Horton, in response to a share raid by Brierley Investments, welcomed the Irish media company Independent Newspapers Plc (INP) as a major shareholder. INP quickly gained control and by April 1998 wholly owned Wilson &amp; Horton. In 2001, INP sold its shareholding to APN News and Media, an Australian media company it partly owned. </p> <p> In early 2007 the Daily Chronicle switched from broadsheet to tabloid format and, interestingly, given subsequent developments, won the 2007 PANPA (Pacific Area Newspaper Publishers’ Association) Newspaper of the Year Award for newspapers of under 15,000 circulation. </p> <p> The next year APN announced that the Chronicle was ending six days a week publication and would be distributed free to every household in Levin and surrounding districts, on Wednesday and Saturdays. </p>     </div>"},

In this role, she had oversight of all nursing matters. Using her own funds and working in her own time, she established Kai Tiaki, first published in January 1908. The quarterly publication cost the princely sum of four shillings a year. In her inaugural editorial on the purposes of the journal, Maclean said she wanted it to be  ‘. . . a bond of union, a common interest,  a means of communication, a mutual help, and a road to improvement in their professional work and knowledge, to all nurses of the Dominion . . .’   </p>       <p> Maclean chose the title, wanting it to be distinctive and suggestive of the journal’s country of origin. It was suggested to her by a Government interpreter, in response to a request from Maclean.  Kai tiaki, in Māori, contains meanings associated with guardianship and protection. The journal has undergone a number of name changes but, despite its official titles, it has always been referred to by the profession at large, as simply Kai Tiaki. </p>       <p> It was first registered as a magazine in 1912. </p>       <p>Maclean maintained ownership of the journal, which reported extensively on nurses’ involvement in World War 1 and on the influenza epidemic of 1918, in which more than 8000 New Zealanders, including some 30 nurses, died.

The journal subscription increased to six shillings a year. The following year the first sub-editor was appointed, and in 1930 Kai Tiaki expanded to become a bi-monthly publication. That year also saw a name change to New Zealand Nursing Journal (Kai Tiaki). </p>       <p> In 1932 Maclean, the journal’s founder and editor for 24 years, died. </p>       <p> From 1939 to 1947 Kai Tiaki was published monthly but in 1942 wartime regulations controlling the use of newsprint saw the number of pages in each issue reduced to 28, then 24.

		    "<div class=\"inner-contentwrap\">       <p> Because European occupation and development of the King Country came much later than most other parts of New Zealand, newspapers also came relatively late to the area. The King Country was the heart of the Maori King movement, in parts still strongly antagonistic to European settlement, so it was not until the main truck railway line pushed through the area that towns developed. The railway from Auckland reached Te Kuiti, a Maori village, in 1887. European settlement dates from that year, when a railway construction camp was established, including an iron foundry to make girders for the Waiteti Viaduct. The main trunk line slowly extended south, reaching Taumarunui in 1901. </p>     <p> It has been claimed that, at the beginning of the 20th century, there were 134 Europeans in Te Kuiti but the completion of the rail link brought in more settlers, the beginning of pastoral farming and cutting down of dense forests.

Hayward left shortly afterwards, and edited the New Zealand Farmer in Auckland until his death in 1914. Matthews continued to run the paper for a number of years. </p>     <p> In the early years of settlements, newspapers saw ‘boosterism’ – the boosting and often exaggerated promotion of their communities as a key role. When Te Kuiti became a borough in 1910, the King Country Chronicle published this doggerel:</p>     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px\"> ‘Ho, Te Kuiti has a Mayor<br> Say the word and hold your breath<br> From the Waipa right to Taupo<br> She’s the greatest and the best<br> From the great majestic river<br> That all nations flock to see<br> Westward to the rolling hills<br> Te Kuiti is the town to be.’</p>     <p>  By 1911, the European population of the King Country was just over 15,000. Te Kuiti and Taumarunui were the largest towns, each with about 1,000 Europeans. </p>     <p>  In May 1918, the New Zealand Herald announced that the Waikato Times Publishing Company and Mr W Thomas, proprietor of the Taumarunui Press, had joined interests and taken over the King Country Chronicle. ‘The business of the three papers will be run in the name of the Waikato and King Country Press’. The agreement was either very short-lived or never finalised because the next year Matthews sold the King Country Chronicle to John Hamill.  His ownership was not without its difficulties. In December 1921 Hamill was the defendant in a Hamilton Supreme Court case, sued for £4,000 by the clerk of the Waitomo County Council, who alleged libel. It was decided the statements published in the King Country Chronicle were defamatory and £50 damages were awarded. The next year the paper was sold again, this time to Samuel Craig, member of an Invercargill printing and publishing family that part-owned the Southland News. </p>     <p>  The King Country Chronicle was subsequently a bi-weekly run in conjunction with the Otorohanga Times (1912), which was begun by ‘rag-planter’ J H Claridge and later purchased by the Craigs. In 1980 the King Country Chronicle and Otorohanga Times were merged. The Waitomo News, as the resulting newspaper was named, was sold to the Spring family in 2002. The free tabloid, delivered on Tuesdays and Thursdays, is part of the Spring’s privately-owned group which includes the Whakatane Beacon, Bay Weekender and Opotiki News. </p>     </div>"},

		    "<div class=\"inner-contentwrap\">       <p>Newspaper publishing began in the Foxton area in the 1870s when the Manawatu was        opened up for European settlement. In this period Foxton’s port was        developed and the town was linked by coach and rail to the main        centres in the lower North Island.</p>             <p>The Manawatu Herald was founded by brothers George Warren Russell and John        Ruffell Russell in 1878. It was the first paper published in Foxton,        following unsuccessful attempts in 1873 to publish a newspaper called the        Manawatu Guardian. George Russell had worked on newspapers in Invercargill        and Wellington and went on to work on others, in particular the Spectator        in Christchurch. He was also a prominent Member of the House of        Representatives and cabinet minister during the First World War. </p>             <p>George Russell did not stay with the Herald for long. By 1882 he had moved on to        the Manawatu Times in Palmerston North leaving his brother with the Foxton        paper. The Herald was sold to Ernest Thynne in 1889. During Thynne’s        tenure the Herald had a rival paper to contend with, the Foxton Telegraph,        which ran for four years from 1896. The local council appear to have        encouraged the Telegraph by dividing council advertising between it and the Herald. This was probably        because Thynne and the Herald represented the rural lobby in Foxton.</p>             <p>In 1906 Thynne sold the paper to John Knowles Hornblow. Hornblow came from a        family of newspapermen; his father wrote for the New Zealand Times, and        Hornblow and his brothers worked on various Wairarapa newspapers. Hornblow        owned the Wairarapa Standard in Greytown before taking over the Herald.</p>             <p>When Hornblow took over the Herald, Foxton was a town with prospects. There        were plans to extend the port and it was hoped that the main trunk line        would go through Foxton. Unfortunately within a year or two these        prospects were gone. The port development did not go ahead and the railway        that was completed in 1908 bypassed Foxton. Despite this Hornblow and his        son Robert managed to keep the Herald running, with Robert taking over as        proprietor after his father died in 1937. The paper changed hands several        more times before ceasing publication in 1997.</p>             <p>The Herald was initially published twice a week then moved to thrice weekly in        1890, back to bi-weekly in 1944 and then weekly from 1956.

Early in the 20th century the labour movement had two main strands – those wanting revolution and those working for reform and both had publications reflecting their views. Militant trade unionists did not fit easily into either camp. The Shearers’ Union in Christchurch felt the full weight of press condemnation after a 1910 wage dispute and decided to begin their own paper, The Maoriland Worker, as a monthly. The newspaper was produced in Christchurch for a short period, with Ettie Rout and Alexander Wildey prominent.  When the shearers’ and miners’ unions combined forces, the paper now represented the ‘Red’ Federation of Labour and, early in 1911, moved its publishing office to Wellington. </p>     <p> The paper, now a weekly, grew rapidly in circulation and influence under the editorship of Australian Bob Ross. It had a circulation of 8,500 by 1912 and 10,000 by the beginning of the next year. It was at the centre of the Federation’s push for socialism. Unionists were enthusiastic ‘paper boys’ and there was a network of voluntary correspondents around the country. The Maoriland Worker’s editorial policy was firmly behind industrial unionism, international co-operation among unionists and pacifism.  </p>     <p> The Maoriland Worker was produced to a high professional standard and included some of the most penetrating political cartoons of the period.  Ross had left by 1913, and his replacement, Harry Holland, was later leader of the Labour Party. Holland was charged with sedition for his coverage of a waterfront dispute that snowballed into a general strike late in 1913. He was sentenced to a year in prison, and served a little over three months. When war broke out shortly afterwards, the Maoriland Worker took an uncompromising international socialist position and Holland editorialised that world revolution was at hand. He left the paper in 1918 when elected to Parliament at a by-election. </p>     <p> The weekly continued to express its radical views through the war years and until the early 1920s. During the First World War it struggled with libel costs, censorship and police harassment. In October 1921 The Maoriland Worker carried two poems by the noted British war poet Siegfried Sassoon.  Three lines of ‘Stand to: Good Friday Morning’ attracted the attention of the authorities and the paper’s publisher was charged with ‘blasphemous libel’. John Glover was tried in the Supreme Court in 1922, still the only such case in NZ legal history. The trial was held at a time when any dissent was suppressed wherever possible and politicians were preoccupied with maintaining ‘social order’, religion an important component of this. Glover was cleared of the charge, but the jury added a rider to its acquittal noting that the publication of such material should be discouraged.  </p>     <p> In 1924, the publication’s name was changed to the New Zealand Worker. The paper’s sub-title also changed. It went from ‘A journal of industrial unionism, socialism and politics’ to ‘A New Zealand paper for New Zealand people’. Although trade unions still funded its publication, control now rested with the Labour Party.  The radicalism softened rapidly and substantially as the Labour Party sought electoral respectability. </p>     </div>"},

The population of the province was small and Marlborough already had two          newspapers. A third, the Marlborough Times, had folded the year before          after a few months in operation.</p>               <p>The Express was founded by Samuel Johnson. Johnson already had some experience          as a journalist in England and New Zealand. He had arrived in 1862 with          the Albertians, a band of idealistic settlers who settled in North Auckland.          Johnson edited the Albertian newspaper the Albertland Gazette for a short          time until he became disillusioned with the settlement. He then worked          on newspapers in other parts of the country before settling on Blenheim.</p>               <p>Politics in Marlborough was dominated by rivalry between Blenheim and          Picton, and this was reflected in the Marlborough newspapers. Originally          the Press was published in Blenheim but had moved to Picton. The publishers          tried to placate Blenheim residents by saying that the paper was actually          published in both places, but eventually they had to publish a separate          Blenheim paper, the Wairau Record. When launching the Express Johnson          promised to give Marlborough a paper that would serve the whole province.          Perhaps it was this attempt to rise above the squabbling between Blenheim          and Picton that helped the Express establish itself and ultimately prevail          over its rivals. </p>               <p>In 1879 Johnson sold the Express to Smith Furness and James Boudy.

		    "<div class=\"inner-contentwrap\">       <p> The Mount Ida Chronicle and St Bathans Weekly News was one of the earliest goldfields newspapers to survive for a lengthy period. In May 1863, gold was discovered in the Hogburn Valley, on the Upper Taieri Plain 90 miles north-west of Dunedin, by a party of miners including the Parker brothers. The resulting township had various names – including Parker’s, Hogburn and Mount Ida – before settling on Naseby. The Mount Ida Chronicle was founded there in 1869 by Hugh Wilson who ran the paper with a succession of partners until his retirement in 1919. </p>     <p> The first partner was Henry Hertslet, a considerable landowner, whose involvement lasted only a year. Two years later Cecil de Lautour joined the paper as partner and editor, combining his editorial role with an increasing involvement in politics. In 1874, de Lautour was elected as one of the two members to represent the Mount Ida district on the Otago Provincial Council, remaining on it until its abolition in 1876. The same year he was returned as the member for Mt Ida in the House of Representatives, and won two subsequent elections in 1879 and 1881.  Cecil de Lautour’s actual involvement with the newspaper ended when he left the district in 1879 and moved to Poverty Bay. </p>     <p> Wilson’s next partner, from 1883, was Mackay J S (Scobie) Mackenzie. A successful runholder, he was also an aspiring politician. After some years on the Maniototo County Council, Mackenzie stood against de Lautour at the 1881 election, challenging the incumbent’s right to represent Mt Ida when he lived hundreds of kilometres away in the North Island. As the Otago Witness reported in Mackenzie’s September 1901 obituary:  ‘The contest which ensued had a sensational termination. Telegraphs were rarer in those days, and on the evening of the election it was concluded, in the absence of one or two outlying returns, that Mr Mackenzie was the member for Mount Ida. He was carried in triumph through the streets of Naseby, while his opponent left the town and travelled through the night to catch train and steamer for the north. Before daylight, however, a block vote for Mr de Lautour came in from the largest of the outlying places, and by a few votes the position was reversed.’ </p>     <p> Scobie Mackenzie was elected to the House of Representatives in 1884, while de Lautour contested an Auckland seat unsuccessfully. Mackenzie was an accomplished journalist, writing regularly for the Mount Ida Chronicle and Australian newspapers. He served three terms as MP for Mount Ida and then held, from 1896-1899, a Dunedin seat. In 1896 his shares in the newspaper were sold to a relation-by-marriage, Alfred Dillon Bell, brother of Sir Francis Bell. John Reed took up the Bell interest in 1907 and ran the business following Wilson’s 1919 retirement until the newspaper’s 1926 sale and subsequent demise. </p>     <p>  For much of its 57 years, the Mount Ida Chronicle was a weekly. Gold in the area was mined by hydraulic sluicing and the government built several miles of water races in 1875. Following this boost to the local mining industry, the newspaper appeared twice-weekly until 1899. Naseby was the commercial and local government centre of the Maniototo for the last 25 years of the 19th century and by 1880 one of the largest towns in the district, and claiming a population of about 4,000. As well as many hotels,  it had the county council chambers, town hall, courthouse, warden’s office, district hospital, several churches and schools, Masonic hall, Athenaeum (library and reading room), and racecourse. However, by the early 1920s, gold mining was finished and, with the Central Otago railway bypassing the town, Ranfurly became the new district centre. </p>     <p>  The Mount Ida Chronicle provided informed and contrasting political comment during the period Cecil de Lautour and Scobie Mackenzie were writing for it. Before the parliamentary party era, both were independents, but de Lautour was of a liberal and Mackenzie a more conservative persuasion. The paper also provided a detailed coverage of an important period in the country’s gold mining history and was a conscientious recorder of the social life of the Maniototo. </p>     </div>"},

Robert Lucas,           a printer who arrived in Nelson in 1859, started the paper. He had           previously published two other, short-lived papers - the Nelson           Advertiser (1860) and the Nelson Intelligence (1862).</p>          <p>At the time the Mail began publication there were already two           existing newspapers in Nelson - the Examiner (1842-1873) and the           Colonist (1857-1921). The Mail provided strong competition for           them. It first forced the papers to go daily and then eventually           observed their demise -  the Examiner in 1873 and the Colonist           in 1921.</p>          <p>Since then the Mail has been Nelson's only daily newspaper.

It was established by Charles Elliott (1811-1876) in 1842, within a few weeks of the New Zealand Company settlers arriving in Nelson.</p> <p>The Examiner, like its contemporary in Wellington, the New Zealand Gazette, was founded with a loan from the New Zealand Company. And even though the loan was paid back within a few years and despite disavowals from Elliott, the paper was always regarded by many colonists as an organ of the Company. Certainly the Examiner expressed very similar views to the Company, particularly concerning representative government for the settlers and it was an unrelenting critic of the colonial administration in Auckland.</p> <p>According to Thomas Hocken, the Examiner was “esteemed the best of all early New Zealand newspapers, and had eminent colonists as its editors and contributors”. These contributors included prominent politicians such as Alfred Domett, Francis Dillon Bell, Edward Stafford and William Fox.</p> <p>Elliott himself was politically active, holding various offices in the provincial government of Nelson in the 1850’s and 1860’s.</p> <p>Ultimately the Examiner was unable to compete with the two other Nelson papers, the Colonist and the Nelson Evening Mail. The Examiner was too closely aligned with the interests of the large run-holders in the Wairau, who included Charles Elliott and his brother James. The Colonist was established in 1857 to oppose these landed proprietors. The paper lost much of its support when the Wairau was incorporated into the neighbouring province of Marlborough in 1859.</p> <p>The Examiner tried to compete by moving to daily publication in 1873 and setting up subsidiary publications. These included the Illustrated Examiner (1869), the Weekly Examiner (1873), Wakamarina Intelligencer (1874). None of these publications could be sustained and the paper folded in 1874.</p>     </div>"},

It was a forerunner to the        Government Gazette as it was used by the colonial administration to        publish official notices. The Advertiser also was effectively suppressed        by the government for criticising its policy on land.</p>             <p>The Advertiser was published in Kororareka from June to December 1840 and ran        for twenty-seven issues. It was printed by G. A. Eager and edited by the        Rev. Barzillai Quaife.</p>             <p>The paper owed its existence to the government who used it as their gazette.        While this was its primary function the newspaper also represented settler        opinion, particularly concerning land claims. On this issue Quaife was        critical of the colonial administration. </p>             <p>The government responded by invoking anti-press laws instituted in New South        Wales in 1827 (New Zealand, at this stage was subject to New South Wales        law). The cost of complying with these laws was more than the paper could        bear and it suspended publication in December 1840. It seems clear that        this is what the government intended. The anti-press laws had hardly been        enforced and compliance was required only after Quaife started criticising        the government.</p>             <p>On 30 December 1840 the Government began publishing its own gazette. In the        first issue it was claimed that the Advertiser was no longer being used        for government notices because the newspaper had declined to publish them.        This was greeted with disbelief by settlers, who found it hard to accept        that the newspaper would turn down the very business that sustained it.        The government copped much criticism for its actions from the New Zealand Gazette,        New Zealand’s other newspaper at the time.</p>             <p>History repeated itself in 1842 when Quaife went on to edit another newspaper, the        Bay of Islands Observer. He continued to criticise government policy on        land and the government responded by effectively putting him out of        business, although this time with threats of libel actions. </p>     </div>"},

		    "<div class=\"inner-contentwrap\">       <p>The New Zealand Colonist and Port Nicholson Advertiser illustrates the           factionalism and divergent interests of the early Wellington colonial community.           The newspaper was published to counter the New Zealand Company's New Zealand           Gazette.</p>          <p>The Gazette had been established in August 1839 by Samuel Revans who was a staunch           friend and advocate of the Company. The Gazette's editorial policy was extremely           pro-Company. Revans believed that serving the interests of the Company would also           serve the interests of the settlement and the settlers. To this end he deliberately           censored anti-Company opinions. His championing of the Company became increasingly           unpopular as the settlers' and the Company's views and interests diverged.</p>          <p>The Gazette's factional and increasingly anti-settler position eventually led           to a group of fifty local merchants and landowners establishing a rival paper,           the New Zealand Colonist. It started in August 1842 and was published bi-weekly.</p>          <p>As the Colonist was intended to be opposition for the Gazette it took a strongly           anti-Gazette and pro-settler editorial position. However the Colonist struggled           financially from the beginning and its position was made more difficult by lack           of support from the Company, which was one of the main sources of revenue in           the fledgling colony.</p>          <p>The Colonist stopped publication exactly a year after it began, mainly due to           poor sales combined with a ruinous fire in its Lambton Quay office.

In 1876, Alfred Horton, a journalist and printer by training, sold his interest in the Thames Advertiser and bought Vogel’s then-ailing Daily Southern Cross. Shortly afterwards William Wilson died and the next year Horton and Wilson’s two sons merged their interests - the stronger mastheads surviving. The New Zealand Herald absorbed the Daily Southern Cross and its Weekly News incorporated the Weekly Herald. </p> <p>   </p> <p> By the late 1870s the Auckland newspaper scene was dominated by the New Zealand Herald, in the morning, and the Auckland Evening Star (later Auckland Star) at night. The New Zealand Herald was consistently conservative; the Evening Star supported the liberal political movement that was beginning to gain ground. </p> <p>   </p> <p> Alfred Horton’s interest in fast-changing newspaper technology led to Wilson and Horton’s installation of the country’s first rotary press at the New Zealand Herald in 1883. This was followed by a web machine in 1887 and linotypes in 1898. It was also the first local newspaper, in 1909, to run classified advertisements, with products and services sorted in categories. </p> <p>   </p> <p> Horton also played a part in the founding of the NZ Press Association in 1878, which began to share local news among newspaper members and to channel news received from overseas. A year later he assisted in resolving problems with a rival news agency that led to the two joining forces as the United Press Association. The name changed back again to New Zealand Press Association in 1942. </p> <p>   </p> <p> For decades the New Zealand Herald changed little in its appearance and sober, right-of-centre editorial stance; this was epitomised for half a century by the generally conservative cartoons of Gordon Minhinnick. The sobriquet ‘Granny Herald’ was part affection, part frustration. </p> <p>   </p> <p> The New Zealand Herald became a public company in 1925, but a majority shareholding was retained, along with all the directorships, by the Wilson and Horton families. In 1996 the Dublin-based Independent News &amp; Media Group bought the Horton family’s shareholding.

It is also likely that the New Zealand periodicals suffered from competition with local newspapers, particularly the illustrated weeklies such as the Free Lance and Weekly News.

The Gazette, a New Zealand company newspaper under the editorship of Samuel Revans, had been so vociferous in its attacks on the colonial administration that many settlers wanted a newspaper that was more temperate. However the Spectator soon found itself embroiled in conflict, when the paper’s printers published an item from Revans that was clearly an attack on local lawyer Daniel Wakefield (younger brother of Edward Gibbon Wakefield). The publishers dismissed the printers who responded by setting up a rival newspaper, the Wellington Independent. The Spectator immediately tried to put the Independent out of business by taking back the printing plant that they were using. The Independent got its own equipment and was back in business four months later. The Spectator and the Independent warred continually for years, advocating for opposing parties in local, provincial and national politics.</p>     <p>From 1845 to 1858 the Spectator was published in Manners Street at the printing works of Robert Stokes (c.1810-80).

		    "<div class=\"inner-contentwrap\">       <p>The North Otago Times was first published on 25 February 1864 under the          title Oamaru Times and Waitaki Reporter.</p>       <p>The paper was founded by Frank Pinkerton. In 1870 William Jukes Steward          was the registered owner and the title was changed to the North Otago          Times. Initially the paper had been issued weekly, but in 1876 it began daily          publication. This was in anticipation of the setting up of a rival daily,          the Oamaru Mail. The rivalry was real but sporting - the Times printed          the first issue of the Mail in 1876 when the Mail's equipment failed. </p>       <p>The Mail was started by William Jukes Steward, the local MP, who had previously owned          the Times. Steward and some associates probably started          the paper to provide a forum for their political views particularly those          concerning the abolition of provincial government in New Zealand. Steward          was in favour of abolition even though the Otago MPs tended to favour          retention of the provincial system.</p>       <p>Initially the Mail struggled against the Times and the paper soon changed          hands. However the Mail was given an unexpected boost in 1877, as a result          of the new owner George Jones being tried by the House of Representatives          for criminal libel for comments printed in the Mail. This was the first          state trial ordered by Parliament. Jones was acquitted and gained a reputation          as a champion of freedom of the press. The public showed its appreciation          by patronising the Mail. Its circulation and advertising rose. The Mail          ultimately triumphed over the Times - it is still published whereas the          Times ceased in 1932.</p>     </div>"},

In 1891 there was the Kamo and Hikurangi Gazette which probably only lasted a year. A potentially serious competitor emerged in 1902 - the Northern Chronicle. The publisher of this paper was Francis Mander. Mander, the father of the author Jane Mander, was a local MP and businessman. However before the Chronicle got established, Mander acquired the Advocate and closed the Chronicle. For a short time in the 1900s there were two daily newspapers in Whangarei besides the Advocate. These were the Whangarei County Press (1905-1908?) and the Northern Mail (1908-1914?). Whangarei could not support three newspapers and The Press closed down almost immediately. The Mail and the Advocate enjoyed a lively rivalry until 1914 when the owners of the Mail acquired the Advocate.

The Truth was launched, in Wellington, by the Australian newspaper publisher John Norton in June 1905.  </p>     <p> Norton owned a stable of Truth newspapers in Australia, starting with the Sydney Truth in 1896. The Sydney Truth’s mix of radical politics and muck-raking proved very popular and Norton established similar papers in the other states before crossing the Tasman. In New Zealand he stuck with the same formula and achieved the same results. By 1930 the Truth was selling 100,000s of copies each week. </p>     <p> The Truth stood out from the other New Zealand newspapers because it was overtly political and reported the unseemly aspects of life in immoderate prose. Under Robert Hogg, editor from 1913 to 1922, the paper was strongly socialist. It supported the revolutionary Industrial Workers of the World during the 1913 general strike, opposed conscription during the World War One and published letters from pacifist Archibald Baxter. </p>     <p> The Truth’s politics moved right-wards in the 1920s after John Norton’s son Ezra assumed control. Hogg was dismissed and the paper took a more conservative and populist line from which it never deviated, attacking liberal causes with alacrity. However the commitment to investigative journalism and exposing political corruption remained. The paper was responsible for some major scoops in the next few decades. The Truth grew in popularity although not respectability, circulation reaching about 240,000 copies a week in the 1960s. </p>     <p> Ezra Norton sold the Truth to a consortium of local businessmen in 1951. In 1978 Independent Newspapers acquired the paper and in 1982 they moved it to Auckland. Here the paper went into a sharp decline. Tabloid journalism was now the norm and the paper lost the vitality that being at the centre of politics had given it. Weekly sales were down to 12,500 when the paper was sold in 2007. </p>     <p> Note: no issues are known to exist of the first year of the NZ Truth. </p>     </div>"},

		    "<div class=\"inner-contentwrap\">       <p> It is thought that the Oamaru Mail (first called the Evening Mail) began in order to express opposing views to those being expounded in the North Otago Times about the abolition of the New Zealand provincial system. William J Steward, who owned the North Otago Times between 1870 and 1897, at times in partnership with others, supported the abolition of the provincial system. </p>     <p> Steward was a Member of Parliament for the single-seat Waitaki electorate from 1871-1875, but lost the next election to two provincialists in the then, two-seat electorate.  He returned to Parliament in 1881 and was Speaker of the House of Representatives from 1891-1893. </p>     <p> Because there was considerable support for the provincial system, particularly in the far south of the country, a group of prominent Oamaru residents decided they would begin a new daily newspaper to promote this, which they did in April 1876.  However, the North Otago Times, first as the bi-weekly Oamaru Times and Waitaki Reporter, then as a tri-weekly, became a daily at the beginning of January 1876, pre-empting the new opposition by three months. Further, there was an inauspicious launch for the Evening Mail when its second-hand machinery broke down. As often happened in the early days of newspapering in New Zealand, the North Otago Times obliged by printing its rival’s first issue. </p>     <p>  It was doubtful whether Oamaru’s small population could support two dailies. The township had been surveyed as recently as 1860 and it grew slowly as an agricultural/pastoral service centre until, with the construction of a breakwater in the early 1870s, it became a major port for the region. Certainly, the Evening Mail found the going hard and in early 1877, the provincial system now legislated out of existence, the original Evening Mail Company was wound up. </p>     <p> At this point George Jones arrived in Oamaru, following his founding of and brief association with the Evening News in Dunedin, and bought the paper. Born in New Zealand but apprenticed in Australia, Jones was printer of the Auckland Star before launching the Waikato Times in 1872 and the short-lived Echo in Auckland two years later. It took a cause célèbre to put the Evening Mail on a firmer financial footing. </p>     <p> In 1877 the paper accused politician Sir Frederick Whitaker of having a personal interest in native land his planned legislation would make available for sale. Jones was summoned to the bar of the House of Representatives and then prosecuted for criminal libel. He was acquitted, the legislation withdrawn and the Ministry defeated shortly afterwards. The Evening Mail had successfully underscored the ‘freedom of the press’ principle and the attendant publicity provided the paper with a surge of reader and advertiser support. </p>     <p> The Oamaru Mail, as it was now called, could afford to take up, with other evening papers, a special telegraphic service originated by the Dunedin Evening Star and was one of the early papers outside metropolitan areas to install linotype machines. In 1909 the Oamaru Mail business was formed into a private company, at about the same time as George Jones bought the Southland News. He and his sons continued to play a prominent part in the company. </p>     <p>  Jones also had a lengthy political career. He briefly represented Waitaki in the House of Representatives in the early 1880s and was a member of the Legislative Council for a quarter century from 1895. </p>     <p> According to the Cyclopedia of New Zealand [Otago &amp; Southland Provincial Districts] in 1905:  ‘The first edition of the ‘Mail’ is published daily at 3 p.m., and is timed for despatch by various trains. The journal is a four page paper of twenty-eight columns, and has a daily circulation of 2,100 copies throughout the North Otago and South Canterbury districts. The ‘Oamaru Mail’ office is centrally situated in Tyne Street. It is a two-storey stone building, which was erected for the domicile of the paper. A water motor, supplied from the corporation water works, and a gas engine drive the plant, which consists of a two-feeder double royal Wharfdale machine, two Platen machines, three linotypes, and other up-to-date appliances, besides an ancient machine on which, it is said, the first issue of the ‘Melbourne Age’ was printed and also the first issue of the ‘Otago Daily Times’.’ </p>     <p> The Oamaru Mail was owned by descendants of the Jones family until the 1970s when it was bought by NZ News Ltd, a Brierley subsidiary, then by Wilson and Horton which, in turn, was sold to APN NZ Media. In November 2011, the Oamaru Mail became a five-mornings-a-week tabloid paper. </p>     <p> In 2013, the Oamaru Mail was bought by a private, family-owned Christchurch company, Mainland Media Ltd. The company also bought the Christchurch Star and six other community newspapers in the greater Christchurch area previously owned by APN. Charlotte Smulders, co-owner with her husband, is a member of the Smith family which controls Allied Press and the Otago Daily Times. The Oamaru Mail has a paid circulation of about 2,900 copies.</p>     </div>"},

It was a liberal paper and set out to challenge the more conservative Evening News. One of the Star's owners, Henry Brett, was an important figure in the development of the press in New Zealand.

He was also a director and chairman of the Press Association and an original member of the Newspaper Proprietors Association.</p>     <p>The Star was popular and successful from its inception, despite having a number of rivals in the 1870s and 1880s. In addition to the Observer these also included the Free Lance, set up by John Dickson Wickham in 1879.</p>     <p>In 1884 the Observer's publishers put out the Evening Telephone to compete with the Star.

It became well established in the 1890s and similar publications were started in Christchurch (the Spectator) and Wellington (the New Zealand Free Lance).</p>     <p>Like the other pictorial weeklies, the paper went into decline in the first half of the 20th century and stopped publishing in November 1954.</p>     </div>"},

They were           particularly popular in isolated rural areas where poor access prevented           newspapers being delivered daily.

The Witness took its           title from the Edinburgh Witness, which was a popular journal in           Scotland. In its early years the Witness took a high moral stance.

The newspaper's fortunes were secured in the           1860s by the influx of people into Otago looking for gold.

		    "<div class=\"inner-contentwrap\">       <p> The Press published its first weekly issue on 25 May 1861 – a six page paper every Saturday costing 6d – a decade after the Lyttelton Times made its appearance as Canterbury’s first newspaper. But it did have the distinction, in March 1863, of being the province’s first daily – 5,000 copies of the four-page paper were printed, selling for 3d a copy. Shortly afterwards, advertisements replaced articles on the front page. </p>     <p> In 1861, the principal backer was James Edward FitzGerald, Canterbury’s first superintendent and MP for Lyttelton – and also the Lyttelton Times’ first editor. FitzGerald, returning to Canterbury after an extended period back in England, disapproved of the extravagant and ambitious plans – including a Lyttelton rail tunnel – of his successor William Moorhouse. As the Lyttelton Times supported Moorhouse’s expensive schemes, FitzGerald, and like-minded settlers, put up the capital to underwrite a rival publication with a different vision for Christchurch. In the beginning, with FitzGerald writing most of the first few issues, there were violent attacks on Moorhouse and his policies but before long the paper adopted the sober, sensible standards that, over the following decades, established The Press’s reputation as New Zealand’s principal ‘journal of record’. An early contributor was Samuel Butler who wrote articles for The Press that were later woven into his famous book Erewhon. </p>     <p> James FitzGerald was nominally sole owner of The Press for several years, although financially indebted to two leading Canterbury businessmen. His association with The Press diminished and later ended following his acceptance of a government appointment in Wellington in 1867. </p>     <p> Technical innovation became a speciality of the private companies that owned The Press, with differing shareholdings, for the next century. In 1893, the Weekly Press, which began in 1865 as a news digest for country districts, produced its Christmas number with a full-colour lithographed art cover and, for the first time, half-tone blocks illustrated the articles. In 1917, Mona McKay became one of the first ‘lady reporters’ in the country to work in a general reporters’ room, long a male preserve. </p>     <p> Prominent staff members included Guy Scholefield, who was associate editor of The Press (1903-04), London correspondent of the NZ Associated Press (1908-19) and later, for 22 years, Parliamentary Librarian at the General Assembly Library. While Oliver Duff was editor from 1929-1932 well-known contributors included Ngaio Marsh, Monte Holcroft and D’Arcy Cresswell. Duff resigned over editorial policy differences with the board involving a tramway strike; in 1939 he became the founding editor of the NZ Listener. </p>     <p> In 1970 the Christchurch Press Co. Ltd. listed on the NZ Stock Exchange; in 1987 Independent Newspapers Ltd took control; and in 2003 ownership passed to the Fairfax Group. </p>     </div>"},

Its first issue in 1905 promised to \"treat of progress in engineering, processes, inventions, industrial work and economics as applied to any of these subjects.\"</p>     <p>In 1910 the magazine was taken over by Harry Tombs (1874-1966). Tombs, son of Whitcombe &amp; Tombs founder George Tombs, was a well-known printer, patron of the arts and publisher of fine arts periodicals. Progress was the first of his magazines; the best known was probably Art in New Zealand (1928-44).</p>     <p>Under Tombs Progress focused on architecture and building; this was signalled by a change of title in 1914 to N.Z.Building Progress. This specialisation was identified by the publishers in the final issue (April 1924) as one of the reasons why they were suspending publication. It was intimated that publication would resume when \"conditions become more favourable\". However Progress was not restarted. Instead, in 1926, Tombs published another architectural magazine, New Zealand Architectural and Building Review. This lasted until Tombs started Art in New Zealand two years later.</p>     </div>"},

He also bought a poorly performing paper, the Gazette, ostensibly serving the Waitemata and Kaipara areas, and used its press to launch Warkworth’s first newspaper. The masthead read Rodney and Otamatea Times, but the secondary heading, Waitemata and Kaipara Gazette, suggested de La Roche had hopes of retaining some readership there.

Two casual workers shared the job of turning the large wheel by hand while the printer fed sheets of newsprint to the rollers.

The Times soon acquired a reputation for its reporting and comment on local politics, but sporting enthusiasts found coverage disappointing. </p> <p>      </p> <p> After de La Roche sold the newspaper to A H Mason late in 1903, his real estate and property activities thrived.

Following his unexpected death in 1955, aged 62, his wife Marjorie headed the company until 1976, buying two opposition papers and withstanding a takeover bid from Wilson and Horton. Their son, Tony Cook, took over as managing director and, converting to web-offset, significantly developed the company’s commercial printing activities.

The paper experienced         financial difficulties, frequent changes of owner and the loss of plant         and offices due to fire. The Times ceased publication for several months         in 1864 after a fire destroyed its office. When it resumed publication         in June that year it was under the new title of the Southland Times.</p>\t\t       <p>In 1875 the Times became a daily. In 1878 fire destroyed the         newspaper office again. As in 1864, the Times’ rival, the Southland News,         helped the paper continue to publish by allowing the Times to use their         presses. During this period the Times published a weekly edition for         its rural readers; the Weekly Times ran from 1866 to 1933.</p>\t\t       <p>In the 1880s the Times achieved stability and prosperity.         This was due in large part to the very capable management provided by         the paper’s owner, Robert Gilmour. Gilmour, who had assumed control of         the paper in 1879, had been involved with the press in Invercargill since         1864. He had briefly owned the Times in 1869, before taking over the         Southland News. In the mid-1870s he had moved back to Scotland for several         years. Upon returning to Invercargill in 1879 he acquired the Times for         a second time.</p>\t\t       <p>The Gilmour family owned and managed the paper until 1984,         when it was sold to Independent Newspapers Limited.</p>\t\t       <p>One of the features of the Times and one of the main reasons         that it has endured is that it stayed abreast of developments in newspaper         technology. In the 1900s it upgraded its plant twice with the introduction         of linotypes and then rotary presses. It was the first newspaper in New         Zealand outside of the main centres to employ rotary presses. In the         1970s and 80s the Times was one of the first papers in New Zealand to         use computer-driven newspaper technology.</p>\t\t       <p>The Times approach to technological change is probably one         of the main reasons that it eventually overtook its old rival the Southland         Daily News.

Probably the most noteworthy thing the Star did in its early years was          to bring out a Saturday night sports edition which immediately became          popular. Things livened up for the Star in 1914 with the publication of          a rival evening paper, the Sun. The Sun was a new type of newspaper in          New Zealand. Modelled on the London Daily Mail it had a bright layout,          heavy use of illustrations and an independent attitude. It was immediately          popular with the public. Christchurch was now overburdened with newspapers          - there were three evening, two morning and two weekly newspapers.</p>       <p>The first casualty was the Evening News which ceased in 1917. The depression          brought further need for rationalisation and competition intensified.          In November 1934 the Star dropped its price from 2d to 1d. The other dailies          in Christchurch soon followed. As a result there was demand for Christchurch          papers outside Canterbury and eventually most South Island papers reduced          their price. The price cutting proved unsustainable and, in June 1935,          the Christchurch morning papers agreed to raise the price back to 2d.          However the struggle continued between the Sun and the Star. The conflict          was settled with help from the Newspaper Proprieters Association. New          Zealand Newspapers Ltd, the owners of the Star and the Lyttelton Times          (now called the Christchurch Times), purchased the Sun and agreed to cease          publication of the Times. The Press Co. purchased the goodwill of the          Times. In June 1935 the Sun was incorporated into the Star and became          a new newspaper called the Christchurch Star-Sun. In the same month the          Christchurch Times ceased, leaving Christchurch with one morning paper,          the Press and one evening paper, the Star-Sun.</p>       <p>The Star-Sun changed title several times and was called the Christchurch          Star when it ceased daily publication in 1991.

In the          provincial elections in 1857 the Herald transferred its support from the          incumbent Superintendent Charles Brown to his rival George Cutfield. Cutfield          won the election and Brown responded by setting up the Taranaki News to          compete with the Herald.

The first issue of the tri-weekly Thames Advertiser and Miners’ News appeared in April 1868. </p>     <p> With the large influx of miners anxious for the latest goldfields news and gossip, the tri-weekly was an immediate success. Within the first year it became a daily and was the major newspaper in the Thames district during the main gold rush era. The bonanza years for the region were from 1868-1871, with impressive gold yields recorded. Gold production topped one million pounds sterling at its peak. The population of Thames built rapidly to 18,000 and it was, at the time, one of the largest towns in New Zealand. Commercial activity mushroomed and there were over 100 hotels vying for business.   The Thames Advertiser thrived in terms of circulation, and advertising was particularly buoyant with hundreds of new businesses needing to promote their presence. There was also a similarly high demand for job printing. As in other gold-mining towns there was a demand for printing ‘scrip’ for mining companies. </p>     <p> Corlett withdrew from the partnership after a couple of years, briefly running a competing, short-lived daily, the Thames Guardian and Mining Record (1871-1872), before spending many years as manager of the Christchurch Press.</p>     <p> In 1872, Wilkinson was joined by Alfred Horton who had previously begun the Timaru Herald.  Horton, who was to become the principal owner of Auckland’s New Zealand Herald, was a very experienced newspaper man and evidence of this was soon seen in the Thames Advertiser. However, Horton moved to Auckland in 1876 following a clash of editorial views. There was a succession of owners after Wilkinson sold the newspaper in the mid-1880s. William McCullough, who was associated with the rival newspaper, the Thames Evening Star (formerly Evening Mail) , purchased the Thames Advertiser in 1912 – and absorbed it into the Evening Star which, in due course, became the Thames Star. </p>     </div>"},

In the 1870s it was one of New Zealand’s most        important newspapers.</p>             <p>The Herald was founded by Alfred George Horton and Ingram Shrimpton. The first        issue was printed on 11 June 1864. Originally publication was weekly.</p>             <p>The Herald was set up to promote the interests of Timaru and Gladstone        districts against those of the Canterbury province to which they belonged.        People in the Timaru area thought they were not getting a fair share of        the revenues collected by the provincial government. Horton’s        involvement in this issue is very clear; he helped promote a bill in        parliament setting up the Timaru and Gladstone Board of Works. This gave        Timaru more control of expenditure on public works in the area and seems        to have satisfied the local desire for independence from Canterbury.</p>             <p>In 1866 the Herald became a bi-weekly, and in 1871 Horton sold to Herbert        Belfield. Horton went on to become one of the most important newspaper        publishers in New Zealand when, in 1876 he joined the Wilson family to        create Wilson and Horton, the publishers of the New Zealand Herald for so        many years.</p>             <p>In the 1870s the Timaru Herald developed into a significant newspaper with a        national reputation. This was largely due to the editor Edward Wakefield.        Wakefield, the nephew of Edward Gibbon Wakefield, was an able and        hard-hitting writer who was active in both local and national affairs. He        was a Member of the House of Representatives in the 1870s and 1880s. As        editor of the Herald he led campaigns that gained Timaru a port and        waterworks. In parliament he had a reputation as a fierce debater but also        for fickleness, which probably prevented him from achieving high office.        In 1876 he was summoned to appear before the House of Representatives on a        charge of breach of privilege after he wrote an article in the Herald that        impugned the integrity of the current Members. The charges were dropped        after Wakefield apologised to the House. During Wakefield’s term the        paper began daily publication. He left the Herald in 1885 when he moved to        Wellington.</p>             <p>During the 1880s the Herald ran into financial difficulties. The Timaru Herald        Company was formed to take over ownership with Herbert Belfield retained        as the manager of the newspaper. In 1886 the paper was leased by its        mortgagees to Joseph Ivess, an indefatigable founder and owner of        newspapers in New Zealand in the 19th century. Ivess is reckoned to have        started twenty-six newspapers; characteristically he did not stay with the        Herald for long.</p>             <p>In 1887 the paper was sold to Edward George Kerr. Kerr already owned another        Timaru newspaper, the South Canterbury Times. Kerr ran the Times and the        Herald from the same building, with the Herald published in the morning        and the Times in the evening. The Times was closed in 1901 as part of a        deal Kerr made with the other morning paper, the Timaru Post. Kerr        persuaded the Post to switch to evening publication, becoming in effect        the evening edition of the Herald. In 1923 the Herald began to subsidise        the Post to keep it going. The Post ceased in 1939.</p>             <p>The Kerr family owned and managed the Herald until the 1980s when it was sold        to Independent Newspapers Limited (INL).</p>     </div>"},

In 1901, the Geddis-Blomfield partnership renamed the paper the Waihi Daily Telegraph. The last issue of the Waihi Chronicle was on 1 March 1901; the first issue of the Waihi Daily Telegraph, billed as an up-to-date, one penny evening daily, appeared three days later. It printed a wide range of overseas cables as well as local news and was a steadfast supporter of the mining industry. </p>                   <p> One typical editorial, in March 1905, was highly critical of the Hon James McGowan, Minister of Mines, who had made his portfolio ‘.... a comfortable means to a comfortable end’ and ‘has displayed parsimony towards the industry that he ought to have fostered, but it is reassuring to learn on such high authority [Prime Minister Seddon] that the era of parsimony is at an end, and that the goldfields industry is to receive the encouragement that its importance warrants ....’ </p>                   <p> Despite his Auckland newspaper interests, Geddis settled in Waihi for a number of years. As well as securing the newspaper’s future, Geddis was elected to the first Waihi Borough Council in 1902. He left Waihi in 1908 to edit and manage the Napier Daily Telegraph, bought in partnership with Henry Brett and T W Leys. </p>                   <p> The Waihi Daily Telegraph was subsequently run by Nisbet McRobie, formerly manager of the New Zealand Times in Wellington and later president of the Auckland Master Printers Association. At this time Waihi had three times the population of Hamilton and was the Auckland province’s fastest-growing town.

Subsequently, Joseph Payton, now in partnership with W F Roydhouse and Edward Samuel began, in November 1878, the region’s first daily, the Wairarapa Daily. It absorbed one of the town’s struggling papers.  </p> <p>      </p> <p> Initially, Payton was editor, sub-editor and business manager on the four-page evening paper, Roydhouse was general reporter and Samuel supplied articles on a more casual basis. Edward Samuel retired from the enterprise when he was appointed headmaster of the Carterton School in 1880, leaving Messrs Payton and Roydhouse as partners. By 1878 the railway had reached only as far as Featherston, so for the next two years William Roydhouse spent considerable time in the saddle covering events in the lower valley. The railway reached Masterton in 1880, simplifying distribution, previously by relays of horses, and the town grew as Payton had foreseen. The 1878 population of 1,673 had nearly doubled to 3,160 by 1886.     </p> <p>      </p> <p>  The first printing machine consisted of a large non-stop drum, with one employee feeding in the paper at the top and a boy at the back taking off the printed sheets which were then folded by hand. The power was generated by a flywheel turned by two more boys. About 1903, an Elliott printing press was installed, first driven by a gas engine and later converted to electricity.   </p> <p>      </p> <p> In 1892, the paper, now well-established, changed its name to the Wairarapa Daily Times. There was evening competition from the Wairarapa Star for a number of years, one of its editors being Alexander W Hogg, later MP for Masterton and a cabinet minister in 1909. Following changes in ownership, the Star was reborn as a morning daily, the Wairarapa Age, in 1902. Later editors included A H Vile and Guy H Scholefield, who became Parliamentary Librarian in 1926.  </p> <p>      </p> <p> Joseph Payton, who kept plant and type up-to-date, ran one of the country’s best produced provincial newspapers until his death in 1910. It also had a reputation for the quality and depth of its local coverage. A private Payton family company then ran the Wairarapa Daily Times until it merged with the Wairarapa Times-Age in 1938.  In 2002 the newspaper was bought by Wilson &amp; Horton which was subsequently acquired by APN News &amp; Media. </p> <p>     </p> </div>"},

Henry Stokes first proposed the paper in 1856 but initially publication         was held back by lack of equipment. The first issue was produced on         18 September 1856 on a makeshift press, made by staff and pupils         at the local industrial school. Shortly after this Stokes imported         a press from Sydney.</p>               <p>However in the 1860s the paper had competition from the Wanganui         Times and the Evening Herald (later called the Wanganui Herald).         The Times didn't survive the decade but the Herald, under John         Ballance, established itself as a serious rival to the Chronicle.         The Chronicle responded by publishing three times a week in 1867         (publication frequency had been erratic up till then) and then         daily in 1871.</p>               <p>The two papers competed against each other strongly for the next         100 years or more. The Chronicle tended to represent conservative         opinion while the Herald was more liberal. However, the rivalry         was often friendly. In 1888 Ballance let the Chronicle use his         equipment to produce their paper after the Chronicle office         burnt down.</p>               <p>Like many 19th century New Zealand newspapers, the Chronicle         changed hands a number of times. One of the most noteworthy         owners and editors was Gilbert Carson who took over in 1875.         Carson was Mayor of Wanganui from 1881 to 1884 and a member         of the House of Representatives and the Legislative Council.         He proved to be an effective opponent of John Ballance and         the Wanganui Herald.</p>               <p>In the 1970s the ownership and the editorship of the Chronicle         and the Herald merged and the two papers continued to come out         separately (the Chronicle in the morning and the Herald in the         evening). While it may have been intended to keep the papers distinct,         in reality they became like two editions of the same paper. In 1986         the Herald was replaced with a community newspaper of the same name         and the Chronicle continued on as Wanganui's daily newspaper.</p>     </div>"},

He         was soon drawn into journalism through his interest in local         issues.

He was a member of the Wanganui         cavalry troop but was particularly critical of the way military         campaigns were conducted against the Māori in the Wanganui area.         For this he was arrested and threatened with court martial.         Ballance also used the Herald to attack the Chronicle who         responded equally strongly.

In 1845 the Spectator's owners sacked the printers         of the paper after they ran a provocative advertisement. As a         result the printers decided to set up a rival paper - the Wellington         Independent.</p>               <p>The first issue of the Independent came out on 2 April 1845 but         publication stopped four months later when the paper's equipment         was sold to the Spectator to pay off its owner's debts. The owner         of the equipment, Samuel Revans, had previously edited the Gazette         and had also supplied the provocative advertisement to the Spectator         that led to the printers being sacked. By November that year the         Independent got another press and soon established itself as the         more popular paper. It went on to outlive the Spectator by nine         years.</p>               <p>The Independent was more popular because it advocated for         representative government against the Spectator, which supported         Governor George Grey's preference for continuing with colonial         rule.</p>               <p>According to GH Scholefield (Newspapers in New Zealand, 1958) the         Independent was one of the best newspapers in New Zealand.

Before the gold rush there were few European settlers on the West Coast, certainly not enough to sustain a newspaper.</p>     <p>The West Coast Times was the first of many papers to start up in the Hokitika area after the rush began. The Times started in May 1865, only two months after the Provincial Government in Canterbury had proclaimed the goldfield on the West Coast. The paper was founded by John Tyrrell but soon sold to William Shaw, a local politician. Shaw was Mayor of Hokitika in 1867.</p>     <p>That the Times prospered on the back of the gold boom can be seen by its publishing activities. In 1865 a weekly edition for rural readers called the Leader was issued, in January 1866 the Times became a daily, and later that year they published a daily evening paper, the Despatch.</p>     <p>The boom in Hokitika and opposition to Shaw’s political activities encouraged others to set up newspapers in the town. The Times’ most serious rival was the Evening Star, founded by Joseph Klein and James Snyder Browne in 1867 mostly to oppose Shaw. The competition between these papers peaked in 1868 when Klein and Browne provided the financial backing and management for a new morning paper, the Westland Observer. Shaw responded by reviving the Despatch, his evening paper that had gone into abeyance the year before.</p>     <p>However the situation was soon resolved when Shaw decided to leave Hokitika. Klein and Browne bought the Times from him and immediately stopped publishing the Despatch and the Observer. From then to its demise in 1917 the Times’ history was much less eventful. Ownership changed several more times. In 1874 Robert Caldwell Reid took over. Reid was a prominent politician active in both provincial and national government. In the 1880s the paper was sold to Leonard Northcroft and Harry Snow and in 1917 it was sold to Dawes, Nightingale and Co.

At the peak of this gold rush in 1867, Westport’s population was about 1,500 but growth over subsequent decades was slow and sporadic. </p> <p> The first Westport newspaper was quickly on the scene. John Tyrrell, who learnt the printing trade in Dublin, arrived in New Zealand via Australia and a stint with the Melbourne Chronicle, Australia’s first, if short-lived, evening paper. He started the West Coast Times in Hokitika in 1865, launched the daily Waimea Chronicle in early 1866, and then the Westport Times in December that year. He began it as the Westport Times and Buller Express in partnership with Job Munson, an American-born printer, who began in the trade as a 11-year-old. Munson sold his holding several years before becoming a shareholder in the rival Westport News. </p> <p> With Charleston booming, in 1867 the paper’s plant was moved there briefly and, also temporarily, its name changed to Westport Times and Charleston Argus. The name was shortened to Westport Times in 1869. It usually appeared twice weekly but, according to the Union List of NZ Newspapers Before 1940, there may have been periods when it came out three times a week or even daily. </p> <p> In 1871, Irishman Eugene O’Connor, later a prominent South Island politician, briefly owned the paper before setting up the rival Westport News. Tyrrell, owner again, countered by producing the Westport Times as a daily for a period. In the early 1880s Tyrrell bought the Westport Evening Star, which had begun in 1867. In 1883, he was found guilty of libelling Charles Wright, in an ‘Open Column’ letter in the Star in relation to his conduct as borough valuer. Wright was also proprietor of the Buller News. Tyrrell was fined £50.  In 1892, when Tyrrell died, the two papers merged to become the Westport Times and Evening Star.  Later, probably in 1898, the then-daily became the Westport Times and Star. </p> <p> Following  John Tyrrell’s death, Thomas Patrick Williams became the managing proprietor. Born in Auckland, he joined the staff of the Westport Times as printer’s devil in 1872 and had become manager by 1885. The Cyclopedia of New Zealand (Nelson, Marlborough and Westland Provincial Districts), published in 1906, listed William Gothard as editor. An Australian, he had been apprenticed to Tyrrell in 1874, having worked in the Post Office previously and then ‘served through all branches of the newspaper and printing business’.  </p> <p> The newspaper continued as a daily until 1937 and a change of ownership and name. A new private company in Hokitika, with a capital of £300 in £1 shares, took over the Westport Times and Star and called it the Buller Times. It ceased publication on November 1, 1941. </p>     </div>"}
