PROTOTYPE TO-DOS
------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix parliamentary sessions
- Store selections in sessions (for format switching purposes)
- Mark facets when they've been interacted with
- Pagination
- Title pages for other formats
- Fill in front-pages for non-today dates
- Next/prev search results
- Try out cookie-based search history
- Better home page
- Thumbnail/list view switchers
- Add region map (somehow. lightbox?)
- Zoomable view (or equivalent)
	- Leaflet-y?
- Is there an easy way to get search term highlighting? 
- Update URLs, and use 'gem rack-rewrite' to start mapping the rules.


UX QUESTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------
- What do we need to communicate on the zero results pages?
- What do the thumbnail pages for articles look like? 
- Communication around change in date ranges
- Do the facets communicate what's going on?
- Think about Niupepa and Troopship use cases
- Are front pages a good idea, or should we always go straight to articles?
- Do "subject" and "people" facets make any sense in the browse context?
- Do people use the Zoomable view?
- What about ALL of the facets in Manuscripts? 
- TEST EVERYTHING. BE HONEST.



PRE-PRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------
- Think about how facet/title metadata model would work
	- Investigate Backbone/Angular?
	- Number of articles per title per year
	- Facet name, granularity
	- Collections, sub-collections
- Better, more scalable structure of SCSS and reusable widgets
- What do unit/integration tests look like?
- Spec caching/failover parameters
